## Stack
Django 5.2 / DRF 3.18 · PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector (HNSW) · Redis 7 · Celery + Celery Beat · FFmpeg (HLS) · Vite/React (frontend/) · nginx 1.27 (TLS terminator) · Prometheus + Grafana (observability) · Sentry (errors, ready-to-configure)

> **Docker is the only supported way to run EchoFlow locally.** There is no bare-metal install path. The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` provision every dependency (Postgres+pgvector, Redis, MinIO, all Celery queues, ffmpeg, Python 3.11, ML libs, nginx, Prometheus, Grafana) in a single `docker compose up --build`. For production at small scale (~$6/month), use the hybrid deployment: `docker-compose.vps.yml` on a VPS + `docker-compose.laptop.yml` on a laptop + Cloudflare R2 for object storage. See [docs/EXPLAIN/DEPLOYMENT/01-hybrid-deployment-overview.md](docs/EXPLAIN/DEPLOYMENT/01-hybrid-deployment-overview.md).

## Startup sequence (local dev)

**This is the order. Do not reorder it and do not substitute the bare `docker compose` commands** — see the warning at the top of this file. Four things must be up: the container stack, Metro, the HLS Worker, and the `adb reverse` rules for a physical phone.

### 1. Container stack

```bash
cd /home/devansh/Code/EchoFlow
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local ps
curl -kI https://127.0.0.1:18443/health/     # expect HTTP/2 200
```

`--env-file .env.local` is **mandatory**: compose interpolates `DB_PASSWORD` from it, and that value differs from the one the Postgres volume was created with. Omit it and every service dies with `password authentication failed for user "echoflow"`.

### 2. Host processes (Metro + HLS Worker + adb forwards)

One command covers all three. Metro and the Worker are plain host processes, not services, and they die with whatever session started them:

```bash
setsid nohup bash scripts/mobile-dev-supervisor.sh \
  > /tmp/mobile-dev-supervisor.out 2>&1 < /dev/null &
bash scripts/mobile-dev-supervisor.sh --status
```

`setsid` is required — the supervisor dies with its launching shell otherwise, which is the exact failure class it exists to fix. Expected `--status`:

```
adb reverse   : 3/3
metro         : healthy (http://127.0.0.1:8081/status, also http://172.25.186.111:8081)
hls worker    : healthy (http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz)
```

It re-asserts the forwards and restarts Metro/Worker every 30s. **If the Worker is missing, nginx returns `502` for every HLS manifest** — a healthy `/health/` proves nothing about audio.

### 3. Open the mobile dev client (physical device only)

```bash
adb devices
LAN_IP=$(hostname -I | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.' | grep -vE '^(127\.|172\.(17|18|28|29)\.)' | head -1)
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -d "exp+echoflow-mobile://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2F${LAN_IP}%3A8081"
```

Use the **LAN** URL, not `127.0.0.1`. The supervisor starts Metro with `--host lan`, so the bundle no longer depends on an `adb reverse` rule surviving a USB re-enumeration. The dev client re-fetches the bundle on **every** foreground return, not just at launch, so a lost JS context is unrecoverable until Metro answers again — and the app cannot render its own error, because rendering the error *is* the bundle it lost. Symptoms and evidence: [docs/mobile/05-device-control-and-troubleshooting.md](docs/mobile/05-device-control-and-troubleshooting.md).

### 4. Frontend (only for web work)

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev     # https://127.0.0.1:5173  (HTTPS, self-signed)
```

**The dev server is HTTPS-only.** It serves either TLS or plain HTTP on a port, never both, so `http://127.0.0.1:5173` is refused. An already-open `http://` tab cannot even reload. Use `https://127.0.0.1:5173`.

### Canonical local origins

| Purpose | Origin | Configured in |
|---|---|---|
| API | `https://127.0.0.1:18443` | `frontend/.env` → `VITE_API_BASE_URL` |
| Media / HLS edge | `https://127.0.0.1:19443` | `.env.local` → `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` |
| Metro (phone) | `http://<host-LAN-IP>:8081` | supervisor `--host lan` |
| Web page | `https://127.0.0.1:5173` | `frontend/vite.config.ts` |

`.env.local` and `frontend/.env` are **gitignored** — a fresh clone has neither and must set them by hand. `mobile/.env.local` holds `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (baked into the bundle at build time) and points at the host's **LAN** address, so it must be updated whenever that address changes. Do **not** move the HLS origin to the LAN address: it is `127.0.0.1` so the web page origin and media origin share a host, which is what lets the `SameSite=Lax` `ef_hls_token` cookie be sent. Native clients are unaffected — they send `X-EchoFlow-Media-Token` instead.

### Shutdown

**Order matters.** Stop the supervisor first, or it restarts what you just killed.

```bash
kill -TERM "$(cat /tmp/mobile-dev-supervisor.pid 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null
for p in $(pgrep -f 'expo start|wrangler dev|vite'); do
  kill -TERM -"$(ps -o pgid= -p "$p" | tr -d ' ')" 2>/dev/null
done
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local down
```

Each host server was `setsid`'d, so it leads its own process group — signal the **group**, not the pid. Killing the top ancestor frees nothing: `wrangler` respawns its own `workerd` child, which keeps port 8787 and makes every replacement die with `Address already in use`. There is no supervisor to prevent that, hence the group kill.

**Do not add `-v`.** Plain `down` removes containers and the network but keeps the named volumes, so the database and MinIO objects survive. Add `-v` only when you intend to wipe local data. And never `docker compose down` without both `-f` and `--env-file`, which targets a different project and orphans the running one.

## Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build          # 14 services: db, pgbouncer, redis_broker, redis_cache, minio, minio-init, nginx, web, celery, celery_feed, celery_media, celery_beat, prometheus, grafana
docker compose down                # tear down
docker compose logs -f celery_media
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Observability endpoints (after `docker compose up`):
#   Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
#   Grafana:    http://localhost:3000  (admin / ${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD})
```

> **nginx is the only public-facing entrypoint.** It terminates TLS on `:80` (redirect) / `:443` (Django) / `:9443` (MinIO HLS) and forwards plain HTTP to the in-network backends. The `web:8000` and `minio:9000` ports are NOT directly reachable from the host anymore (except `web:8005` which is published as a debug escape hatch). To verify the stack is up: `curl -kI https://localhost/health/`. See [docs/EXPLAIN/docker/05-https-tls-termination.md](docs/EXPLAIN/docker/05-https-tls-termination.md) for the full design.

## Running Tests

> **All tests run inside the Docker `web` container against PostgreSQL.**
> The test database is `echoflow_test` — auto-created by conftest on first
> run. No SQLite, no stub migrations, no bare-metal test mode.

### Quick start (full stack + tests)

```bash
# Build and start test stack (db, redis, minio, web)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build -d

# Run the full test suite (conftest auto-creates echoflow_test DB)
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app web pytest backend/app/tests/ --tb=short

# Run a single test file
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app web pytest backend/app/tests/test_adversarial_pass3.py -v

# Run a single test class
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app web pytest backend/app/tests/test_adversarial_pass3.py::TestN1CommentAuthorization -v

# Run the migration / config / static checks that CI runs
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate --noinput
docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
docker compose exec web python manage.py check --fail-level WARNING
docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --dry-run

# Inspect coverage (with the pytest-cov plugin — installed in the image)
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app web pytest backend/app/tests/ --cov=backend.app --cov-report=term-missing

# Tear down test stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

### Hybrid Deployment (production at small scale)

The hybrid deployment splits services across a VPS (light services) and a
laptop (heavy media worker), with Cloudflare R2 for object storage:

```bash
# VPS: light services (8 containers)
git checkout feat/hybrid-vps
cp .env.vps.example .env
# Edit .env with real values
bash scripts/vps-deploy.sh

# Laptop: heavy media worker (1 container)
git checkout feat/hybrid-laptop
cp .env.laptop.example .env
# Edit .env with real values (DJANGO_SECRET_KEY must match VPS)
bash scripts/laptop-deploy.sh
```

- `docker-compose.vps.yml` — slimmed 8-service compose (removes pgbouncer,
  minio, celery_media, prometheus, grafana)
- `docker-compose.laptop.yml` — single-service compose (celery_media only)
- `scripts/vps-deploy.sh` — one-shot VPS deploy (build, migrate, collectstatic,
  Tailscale setup, daily backup cron)
- `scripts/laptop-deploy.sh` — one-shot laptop deploy (build media image,
  start worker, start heartbeat)
- `scripts/laptop-heartbeat.sh` — background heartbeat writer to Redis
- `backend/app/views/system_health.py` — `/api/v1/health/media-worker/`
  endpoint reporting laptop worker liveness

See [docs/EXPLAIN/DEPLOYMENT/](docs/EXPLAIN/DEPLOYMENT/) for full setup guides.

### Production stack + tests (when you need nginx/MinIO endpoints)

```bash
# Start full stack (db, pgbouncer, redis, minio, nginx, web, celery, etc.)
docker compose up --build -d

# Run tests against the full stack
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app web pytest backend/app/tests/ --tb=short

# Tear down
docker compose down
```

## Observability

Two stacks are available after `docker compose up`:

### Prometheus + Grafana (primary)
```bash
# Prometheus: scrape target, query PromQL
open http://localhost:9090/targets      # confirm web target is UP
open http://localhost:9090/graph        # PromQL query editor

# Grafana: dashboards, datasources auto-provisioned
open http://localhost:3000              # admin / ${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
#   Dashboards > EchoFlow > 01-feed-and-suggestions
#   Dashboards > EchoFlow > 02-celery-health
```

The scraper reads `/metrics/` from `web` every 15s. Two dashboards ship pre-built:
- **01-feed-and-suggestions.json** — p95 of `feed_refill_duration_seconds`, `suggestion_ranking_duration_seconds`, cache hit/miss rate.
- **02-celery-health.json** — `rate(celery_tasks_processed_total[5m])` by queue/task, p95 of `hls_processing_duration_seconds`.

Alert rules are intentionally not shipped in this pass — the audit doc proposes them; this is a follow-up. Add them in `docker/prometheus/alerts.yml` and reload Prometheus when ready.

Full design: [docs/EXPLAIN/observability/03-prometheus-grafana-design.md](docs/EXPLAIN/observability/03-prometheus-grafana-design.md). Activation runbook: [docs/EXPLAIN/observability/04-prometheus-grafana-setup.md](docs/EXPLAIN/observability/04-prometheus-grafana-setup.md).

### Sentry (error capture, ready-to-configure)
`sentry-sdk[django,celery]==2.18.0` is installed; `init_sentry()` runs in each process's `App1Config.ready()`. Errors from web + all 4 celery services are captured when `SENTRY_DSN` is set in `.env`. Gated on `DJANGO_DEBUG=False` so dev/test paths are no-ops.

```bash
# Local: capture_exception is a no-op (no DSN, debug=True)
# Staging/prod: set SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_ENV in .env
echo 'SENTRY_DSN=https://abc123@sentry.io/456' >> .env
echo 'SENTRY_ENV=production' >> .env
docker compose up -d --force-recreate web celery celery_feed celery_media celery_beat
```

The `capture_exception(exc, **context)` wrapper in `backend/app/services/sentry.py` attaches the current request's `correlation_id` (from `backend.EchoFlow.correlation`) as a Sentry tag, so production errors cross-reference with the worker's correlation_id (Group B item 11). `send_default_pii=False` — user IPs, cookies, and auth headers are NOT sent.

### Observability TUI (dev fallback)
```bash
# Run inside the web container (TUI requires urllib; stdlib only, no extra deps)
docker compose exec web python scripts/observability_tui.py

# One-shot snapshot to stdout (useful for scripting)
docker compose exec web python scripts/observability_tui.py --once

# Point at a different /metrics/ URL (e.g. against a staging server)
docker compose exec web python scripts/observability_tui.py --url http://staging:8005/metrics/

# Refresh every 2 seconds instead of 5
docker compose exec web python scripts/observability_tui.py --interval 2
```

The TUI reads `/metrics/` from the running `web` container and prints a text dashboard of the 6 custom application metrics (`echoflow_feed_refill_duration_seconds`, `echoflow_suggestion_ranking_duration_seconds`, `echoflow_toggle_like_duration_seconds`, `echoflow_cache_get_set_duration_seconds`, `echoflow_hls_processing_duration_seconds`, `echoflow_celery_tasks_processed_total`). Refreshes every N seconds (default 5). It is now a dev fallback — Grafana is the primary observability tool.

**Why `docker compose exec web` and not `docker compose run web`?**
- `exec` runs the command in the already-running `web` service (uses its env, mounted volumes, and depends_on the DB/Redis/MinIO). This matches the actual production-like runtime.
- `run` would spin up a fresh container that doesn't have the dependent services linked unless you pass `--service-ports` and explicitly `depends_on` them — which complicates the command for no benefit.

**When a test genuinely needs bare-metal (rare, e.g. debugging an ML model locally):** run the wheelhouse install documented in commit history of the audit-pass-3 dump, set the same env vars the container uses (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_BROKER_URL, REDIS_CACHE_URL, etc.), and run pytest directly. Document the divergence in the PR description.

### Dockerfile architecture
Single multi-stage `Dockerfile` with five stages (two are build-only):

| Stage | Shipped? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | parent of all | apt union (libpq-dev, gcc, postgresql-client, ffmpeg, libsndfile1), appuser (UID 1000) |
| `py-deps-api` | yes, this is preferred | installs requirements-base.txt offline from wheelhouse into site-packages |
| `py-deps-media` | yes, this is preferred | requirements-media.txt + bakes HuggingFace models into the `echoflow-hf` cache mount, then `cp -a` to `/home/appuser/hf_baked` so the models persist into the layer (see "HuggingFace bake copy-to-layer" below) |
| `api` | yes | web, celery, celery_feed, celery_beat — small image, no wheels/models |
| `media` | yes | celery_media — `COPY --from=py-deps-media /home/appuser/hf_baked /home/appuser/.cache/huggingface`; runtime `HF_HOME=/home/appuser/.cache/huggingface` |

Final images receive dependencies via `COPY --from=py-deps-* /opt/venv /opt/venv`
and source via an explicit allowlist (`backend/` — incl. `wait_for_db.py`
and `gunicorn.conf.py`, `manage.py`) — never a blanket `COPY .`. Stage-specific HEALTHCHECKs are
baked in: `api` probes `GET /health/` (compose overrides it to a Celery ping
for the worker services sharing that image); `media` pings its own Celery node.
HF_TOKEN is delivered ONLY via BuildKit secret mount
(`--mount=type=secret,id=hf_token`) — never `--build-arg`, which would persist
the token in builder layer history readable by `docker history`.

**HuggingFace bake copy-to-layer** (added 2026-09-07, fixed the `celery_media` build):

BuildKit `--mount=type=cache` is **ephemeral** — the cache target is a temporary
overlay that exists only during the `RUN` command. Files written into the
cache mount are saved to the BuildKit cache store (for future build speedup)
but are **not** part of the committed layer's filesystem. A subsequent
`COPY --from=py-deps-media <cache-mount-path>` therefore fails with
`not found` — the path exists during the `RUN` but is invisible to the
layer graph.

The fix: after the model download commands, the `py-deps-media` RUN ends
with `cp -a /home/appuser/.cache/huggingface /home/appuser/hf_baked`. This
materializes the cache contents into a regular filesystem path that **does**
persist into the layer. The `media` stage then `COPY --from=py-deps-media
/home/appuser/hf_baked /home/appuser/.cache/huggingface` lands the baked
models at the runtime `HF_HOME` path unchanged. Runtime env vars
(`HF_HOME`, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` in
`docker-compose.yml`) are NOT modified.

Tradeoff: ~250 MB is now in both the BuildKit `echoflow-hf` cache AND the
layer. The BuildKit cache is for cross-build speed (it only costs disk
locally and is not in the image); the layer copy is what's shipped. Final
image size is unchanged at the user-visible layer.

CI guards against regression: `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml` runs a
smoke test on every PR that builds the `media` target, loading the
freshly-built image and asserting the baked HF models load in
`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` mode.

```bash
# Build all targets
docker compose build

# Build a single target manually (media consumes HF_TOKEN as a build SECRET)
docker build --target api   -t echoflow-api  .
export HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx   # or: --secret id=hf_token,src=./hf_token.txt
docker build --target media -t echoflow-media . --secret id=hf_token,env=HF_TOKEN

# Override image tag
docker compose build --build-arg TAG=dev
```

### Offline wheelhouse
All pip installs use `--no-index --find-links=/wheelhouse`. The wheelhouse is a local directory of pre-built wheels that makes builds fully offline and deterministic.

**Regenerate the wheelhouse** (run inside a py3.11 container):
```bash
mkdir -p wheelhouse-new
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/requirements-base.txt:/req/requirements-base.txt:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/requirements-media.txt:/req/requirements-media.txt:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/constraints.txt:/req/constraints.txt:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/wheelhouse-new:/out" \
  python:3.11-slim-bookworm sh -c "\
    pip wheel --no-deps -w /out 'dj-rest-auth==7.2.0' && \
    pip download --prefer-binary --retries 10 --timeout 120 \
      --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
      -c /req/constraints.txt -r /req/requirements-base.txt -d /out && \
    pip download --prefer-binary --retries 10 --timeout 120 \
      --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
      -c /req/constraints.txt -r /req/requirements-media.txt -d /out"

rm -rf wheelhouse && mv wheelhouse-new wheelhouse
```

**Important rules:**
- After regenerating, `rm -rf wheelhouse && mv wheelhouse-new wheelhouse` swaps the directory.
- If you add/change any pin in `requirements-base.txt`, `requirements-media.txt`, or `constraints.txt`, **re-run the regen script first**.
- The `pip wheel --no-deps dj-rest-auth` step pre-builds a wheel for dj-rest-auth (it is sdist-only on PyPI).
- `librosa==0.11.0` — do NOT bump to 1.x (requires Python >= 3.12).
- `django==5.2.17` — do NOT bump to 6.x (requires Python >= 3.12).
- `sentry-sdk[django,celery]==2.18.0` — added when Sentry integration landed (Group B partial-issues, PR 2 of 3). The wheelhouse regen script must include this.

### Pop!_OS note
Uses Docker Compose V2 (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`). If you have `docker-compose` installed from an old PPA, it conflicts with the V2 plugin — remove it with `sudo apt remove docker-compose` and use `docker compose` instead.

### BuildKit cache (named, persistent across builds)

The `Dockerfile` declares three **named** BuildKit cache mounts so cold builds skip the expensive network round-trips on subsequent runs:

| Cache ID | Mounted at | What it holds | Saved per build |
|---|---|---|---|
| `echoflow-apt` | `/var/cache/apt/archives` | Downloaded `.deb` files (`libpq-dev`, `gcc`, `ffmpeg`, `libsndfile1`, `libmagic1`, `postgresql-client`) | ~200 MB; ~1-2 min |
| `echoflow-pip`  | `/root/.cache/pip`     | pip's HTTP/wheel metadata index (resolver cache) | Seconds — only helps repeated installs in the same build |
| `echoflow-hf`   | `/home/appuser/.cache/huggingface` | Baked HF model artifacts (Whisper `base`, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, KeyBERT) | ~250 MB; ~5 min on `media` rebuild |

A dedicated `wheelhouse-base` stage owns the offline `./wheelhouse/` so both `py-deps-api` and `py-deps-media` reference it via `COPY --from=wheelhouse-base` — wheelhouse bytes enter the layer graph exactly once per build.

**Inspect / manage the caches:**

```bash
docker buildx du                                    # show every named cache and its size
docker buildx du --filter type=buildkit             # only BuildKit-managed caches
docker buildx prune --filter type=buildkit          # safe — never touches named caches by default
docker buildx prune --filter id=echoflow-apt        # nuke one specific cache (e.g. after adding a new apt package)
docker builder prune                                # CAREFUL — wipes dangling builders; named caches survive by default
```

**Cache invalidation rules:**
- Adding/changing a package in `Dockerfile` apt-get list invalidates the `base` stage → next build re-downloads everything → caches are repopulated transparently.
- The `wheelhouse/` directory changing (new wheels added) invalidates `wheelhouse-base` → both py-deps stages rebuild.
- HuggingFace model upgrade → invalidate manually with `docker buildx prune --filter id=echoflow-hf`. There is no automatic signal from inside the build that the upstream model changed.
- CI runners (GitHub Actions) start with empty BuildKit **named** caches (echoflow-apt / echoflow-pip / echoflow-hf) — they only speed up repeated local builds on the same machine. The **layer** cache IS persisted across CI runs via `cache-from: type=gha,scope=${{ matrix.target }}` in `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`. The scope is per-matrix-target so a source-only change doesn't bust the heavy media layer cache and vice-versa. The named mount caches (especially `echoflow-hf` at ~250 MB) re-download on every CI run; if that becomes a CI cost issue, see `docs/EXPLAIN/docker/01-multi-stage-dockerfile.md` §"BuildKit cache" for the registry-backed upgrade.

**What is intentionally NOT cached:**
- `/var/lib/apt/lists/` — stale package indexes can silently serve vulnerable `.deb` files. `apt-get update` runs on every build; security wins over re-download speed.

### Runtime notes
- Web container runs: `backend/wait_for_db.py → migrate → collectstatic → gunicorn -c backend/gunicorn.conf.py`.
- `gunicorn.conf.py` uses `preload_app=True` with a `post_fork` hook that resets Django DB connections (critical because `EchoFlow/__init__.py` imports Celery, which creates Redis connections in the master process before fork).
- Health checks: `GET /health/` (liveness), `GET /ready/` (readiness — checks DB), `GET /metrics/` (Prometheus).
- Resource limits defined per-service in `docker-compose.yml` under `deploy.resources`.
- Override gunicorn workers/threads with `GUNICORN_WORKERS` and `GUNICORN_THREADS` env vars.
- **Do NOT** mount `huggingface_cache` volume on `celery_media` — models are baked into the image at build time.
- **PgBouncer (Phase 1.0):** web/celery services connect via `pgbouncer:6432` (transaction pool mode, `AUTH_TYPE=scram-sha-256`). Non-Docker dev (`pip install + runserver`) skips pgbouncer and connects to `localhost:5432` directly via `DATABASE_URL` — both paths work.
- **Split Redis (Phase 1.0):** Docker runs `redis_broker` (noeviction, 512MB, `REDIS_BROKER_URL`) and `redis_cache` (LRU, 1GB, `REDIS_CACHE_URL`) as separate services. Non-Docker dev sets `REDIS_URL` only — both URLs fall back to it.

## Environment Variables (required)
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Django signing key — app fails without it |
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | **Must be `False` in any environment behind the nginx terminator.** Enables the `if not DEBUG:` block (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, HSTS, secure cookies). Default: `False` in `.env.example`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Docker: `postgres://user:pass@pgbouncer:6432/echoflow_db`. Non-Docker dev: `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/echoflow_db` |
| `READ_DATABASE_URL` | Optional. When set, activates the read-replica routing in `backend/app/db_routers.py`. Postgres URL of the streaming replica. See [docs/EXPLAIN/database/05-read-replica-design.md](docs/EXPLAIN/database/05-read-replica-design.md) for the activation playbook. |
| `REDIS_URL` | Non-Docker dev: `redis://localhost:6379/1` (single Redis). Optional in Docker. |
| `REDIS_BROKER_URL` | Broker URL. **Ignored when `REDIS_BROKER_HOST` is set** — compose always sets it, so a stale URL in `.env.local` cannot override the service name. Falls back to `REDIS_URL`. See the gotcha below. |
| `REDIS_CACHE_URL` | Docker: `redis://redis_cache:6379/0`. Falls back to `REDIS_URL`. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace token (model baking at build time). See [docs/EXPLAIN/operations/hf-token-rotation.md](docs/EXPLAIN/operations/hf-token-rotation.md) for the rotation runbook. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional — reserved for OpenAI pipeline branch |
| `SEED_AUTH_TOKEN` | Auth token for `seed_db.py` |
| `GUNICORN_WORKERS` | Default gunicorn workers (default: 4) |
| `GUNICORN_THREADS` | Default gunicorn threads (default: 4) |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated allowed hosts. Must include every host the nginx terminator is reached at (`localhost`, your prod hostname, any Tailscale/CNAMES). Default: `localhost`. |
| `DJANGO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated **https://** origins. Every browser-reachable origin MUST be `https://` once the terminator is live — `http://` here causes mixed-content / CORS preflight failures. |
| `PUBLIC_MEDIA_ENDPOINT_URL` | Browser-facing MinIO origin for HLS playback. **Must be `https://`** (e.g. `https://localhost:9443` in dev). `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` (containers' in-network URL) stays `http://minio:9000`. |
| `MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET` | HMAC signing key for HLS playback tokens. Shared between Django (issuance) and the Cloudflare Worker (validation). Generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`. Must match the Worker secret set via `npx wrangler secret put MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET`. For local dev, `scripts/run-hls-worker-local.sh` generates the Worker's `.dev.vars` from this value so the two cannot drift. See `docs/EXPLAIN/storage/04-hls-token-protection.md`. |
| `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` | Browser-facing HLS origin when it is the **validating edge** (Worker on `media.echoflow.in`, or the Worker behind nginx `:9443`/`:19443` locally). Leave blank with no edge in front. Its presence also sets `HLS_URL_STYLE=edge`. **Must not** be collapsed into `PUBLIC_MEDIA_ENDPOINT_URL`: presigned `uploads/` URLs still need the bucket in the path and the edge serves only `/hls/*`. |
| `HLS_URL_STYLE` | `edge` → bucket-less `{origin}/hls/...`; `bucket` → `{origin}/{bucket}/hls/...`. Defaults to `edge` when `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` is set, else `bucket`. An edge fronting a bucket (R2 custom domain, Worker) does not expose the bucket as a path segment, and the Worker rejects any path not starting `/hls/` — so the bucket-prefixed form 404s there. |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` | Where the **app** connects. `pgbouncer`/`6432` in `docker-compose.yml`; `db_local`/`5432` in `docker-compose.local.yml`. `DATABASE_URL` is built from `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD`/`DB_HOST`/`DB_PORT`/`DB_NAME` by compose — it is deliberately **not** in the env file, because compose does not expand `${...}` there. |
| `TEST_DB_HOST` / `TEST_DB_PORT` / `TEST_DB_NAME` | Where `conftest.py` reaches Postgres **directly** for the test database. Separate from `DB_HOST`/`DB_PORT` on purpose: pgbouncer whitelists only `DB_NAME`, so `CREATE DATABASE` for the test DB is refused through it. Never point `TEST_DB_HOST` at a non-local host — conftest issues `CREATE`/`DROP DATABASE` and `CREATE EXTENSION` against it. |
| `MEDIA_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` | HLS token time-to-live in seconds. Default `600` (10 min). |
| `MEDIA_TOKEN_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | Cookie `Domain` attribute for the HLS token cookie. Leave empty for dev (`localhost` rejects domain cookies). **Required** in production when `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` is a different host from the API: the cookie is set by `api.` and the media origin is `media.`, so a host-only cookie is never sent and every request 403s. Set the shared parent domain, e.g. `.echoflow.in`. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional. When set, the `sentry-sdk` in each process captures uncaught exceptions. Get a DSN from sentry.io (free tier works). |
| `SENTRY_ENV` | Sentry environment tag (e.g. `production`, `staging`). Default: `production`. |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Fraction of requests traced (0.0-1.0). Default: `0.1`. Lower for high-traffic. |
| `SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Fraction of profiled requests. Default: `0.05`. |
| `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial admin password for Grafana (first-boot only). Required — Grafana v11 refuses to start without one. |
| `TERMS_VERSIONS` | Comma-separated consent versions (e.g. `v1.0,v1.1`). Used by `RegisterSerializer` and `ConsentAudit` (`terms_version_id`). Default: `v1.0`. See `settings.py:622`. |
- **Age gate (`dob` is required at registration)**: `RegisterSerializer.dob` is `required=True` as of 2026-09-29. It was optional, which meant a client that omitted it registered as an adult (`is_minor=False`) and had its telemetry processed under the adult path — the optionality *was* the DPDP §9 bypass. Under-18 now requires `parent_email`, sets `is_minor=True`, and `POST /interactions/{id}/log-telemetry/` returns **403** for minors. `minor_consent_verified` is hardcoded `False` (no parental-verification flow exists — no mail backend), so do **not** gate on it; gate on `is_minor`. Likes/skips stay open to minors deliberately. Future and >120-year-old `dob` are rejected (the bound uses `timedelta` arithmetic, not `date.replace(year=...)`, which raises on 29 Feb).
| `COMPLIANCE_OFFICER_NAME` | Chief Compliance Officer name (IT Rules 2021 Rule 4(1)(b)). Served by `/legal/compliance/`. Default: `EchoFlow Compliance Officer`. |
| `COMPLIANCE_OFFICER_EMAIL` | CCO email. Default: `compliance@echoflow.in`. |
| `GRIEVANCE_OFFICER_NAME` | Grievance Officer name (IT Rules 2021 Rule 4(1)(a)). Default: `EchoFlow Grievance Officer`. |
| `GRIEVANCE_OFFICER_EMAIL` | Grievance email. Default: `grievance@echoflow.in`. |
| `NODAL_CONTACT_NAME` | Nodal Contact name (IT Rules 2021 Rule 4(1)(c)). Default: `EchoFlow Nodal Contact`. |
| `NODAL_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Nodal email. Default: `nodal@echoflow.in`. |
| `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME` | **Must be `ap-south-1`** (or `ap-south-2`) for DPDP cross-border + RBI data-localisation compliance. `STORAGES` uses this (`settings.py:467`). Default in `.env.example`: `auto` — production must override. |
| `PHYSICAL_ADDRESS` | Registered office / physical address (IT Rules 2021 / Consumer Protection). Not yet exposed in `/legal/compliance/` endpoint (open). |
| `REVENUECAT_SECRET_KEY` | **Backend-only secret.** RevenueCat secret API key from dashboard → Project Settings → API keys. Never expose to frontend. Required for REST API polling. |
| `REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY` | **Frontend-safe public key.** Used by `@revenuecat/purchases-js` SDK initialization. Safe to expose via `VITE_REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY`. |
| `REVENUECAT_PROJECT_TOKEN` | RevenueCat project token (SDK identifier). |
| `REVENUECAT_ENTITLEMENT_ID` | Entitlement ID string in RevenueCat dashboard (default: `pro`). |
| `REVENUECAT_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | Poll interval for Celery Beat task (default: `360` = 6 hours). |
| `REVENUECAT_CUSTOMER_PORTAL_URL` | Optional override for Customer Portal base URL. |
| `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | HMAC secret for webhook verification (Phase 2 — configure when enabling webhooks). |
| `REVENUECAT_DAILY_UPLOAD_LIMIT_FREE` | Free tier daily upload limit (default: `5`). |
| `REVENUECAT_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_MB_FREE` | Free tier max upload size in MB (default: `10`). |
| `REVENUECAT_CLIP_DURATION_LIMIT_FREE` | Free tier max clip duration in seconds (default: `60`). |
| `REVENUECAT_HD_QUALITY_BLOCKED_FREE` | Block HD quality for free users (default: `True`). |

## Indian Regulatory Compliance

Full compliance details (DPDP Act 2023, IT Rules 2021, CERT-In Directions 2022, Copyright Act 1957, Consumer Protection E-Commerce Rules 2020, RBI Data Localisation) are documented in [docs/INDIA-REGULATORY-READINESS.md](docs/INDIA-REGULATORY-READINESS.md). **Read that doc before touching any of these areas:**

| Scenario / Application | Repo region to check first |
|---|---|
| User registration, consent, age gating | `backend/app/models.py` (User, ConsentAudit), `backend/app/serializers.py` (RegisterSerializer), `backend/app/views/auth.py` |
| Grievance / compliance officer endpoints | `backend/app/models.py` (Grievance, AuditLog), `backend/app/views/data_subject.py` |
| Content moderation pipeline | `backend/app/services/content_moderation.py`, `backend/app/services/uploads.py`, `backend/app/models.py` (AudioClip.moderation_approved) |
| Settings (regulatory contacts, S3 region) | `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py` (lines 622, 643-657, 467-498) |
| Audit logging / CERT-In 180-day retention | `backend/app/models.py` (AuditLog, ConsentAudit), `backend/app/middleware.py` |

## HTTPS / TLS Termination
The stack now ships with an nginx reverse proxy in front of every other service. TLS is terminated at the edge; internal hops (nginx→gunicorn, nginx→minio) stay plain HTTP on the docker bridge. No application code knows TLS exists.

| Concern | Where it lives | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public-facing entrypoint | `docker-compose.yml:nginx` (image `nginx:1.27-alpine`) | Three listeners: `:80` (HTTP→HTTPS redirect), `:443` (Django), `:9443` (MinIO for browser HLS). |
| TLS cert + key | `docker/certs/localhost.{crt,key}` (self-signed dev) | Bind-mounted read-only into nginx; never enters the app image. Production swaps in Let's Encrypt material via the same path. |
| TLS config | `docker/nginx.conf` | TLS 1.2/1.3 only, HSTS 1y+includeSubDomains+preload, `X-Forwarded-Proto https` on every upstream block. |
| Django TLS contract | `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py:529-539` `if not DEBUG:` block | `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`, `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER=('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO','https')`, `SESSION/CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True`, HSTS 1 year. **Requires `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`** — set this in `.env` before going anywhere public. |
| In-container healthcheck | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` (web service) | Sends `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` so `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` doesn't loop the in-container probe. |
| Test coverage | `backend/app/tests/test_https_termination.py` (32 tests) | Cert, nginx config, prod settings, proxy header, public media endpoint, live terminator. |

**Operating rules:**
- **Do NOT change `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` to anything other than `('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')`** without also updating every `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;` line in `docker/nginx.conf`. Mismatch = redirect loop or insecure cookies.
- **The `8005:8000` host port mapping on the `web` service is a debug escape hatch**, not the supported path. Attackers on the same network can hit gunicorn directly and spoof `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` to themselves. In prod, drop that port mapping entirely.
- **Cert rotation is `docker compose exec nginx nginx -s reload`** — no app rebuild, no container restart. The bind-mount picks up the new files.
- **Full design + production-readiness checklist:** `docs/EXPLAIN/docker/05-https-tls-termination.md` and `docs/EXPLAIN/docker/06-https-production-readiness.md`.

```

## Architecture Notes
- **Dual `EchoFlow/`**: Project package (`backend/EchoFlow/settings.py`, `urls.py`, `celery.py`) vs app package (`backend/app/`). Don't confuse them.
- **Custom user model**: `backend.app.User` (extends `AbstractUser`). Set via `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'backend.app.User'`.
- **Recommendation engine**: Composite scoring = 45% vector similarity + 30% avg completion rate + 25% engagement velocity. 80% exploit / 20% explore feed mixing.
- **Redis feed queues**: Per-user `user_feed:{id}` lists. `FastFeedViewSet` pops 10 at a time; refills trigger when queue < 15.
- **Vector fields**: `semantic_vector` (384-dim, from transcript via sentence-transformers), `acoustic_vector` (128-dim, from librosa). HNSW indexes (`m=16, ef_construction=64`) on both.
- **Celery task routing**: `process_audio_to_hls` → `heavy_media` queue; `refill_user_feed` → `fast_feed` queue; `cleanup_orphan_hls` → 03:00 UTC daily; `flush_counters_to_pg` → every 300s (defined in `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py` `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES` + `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`).
- **ML models lazy-loaded**: `get_whisper_model()`, `get_embedding_model()`, `get_kw_model()` in `backend/app/tasks.py` — initialized on first task call, not at import time.
- **`update_global_metrics`** is a no-op stub (deprecated 2026-09). All three responsibilities (counter deltas, avg_completion_rate, engagement_velocity) live in `flush_counters_to_pg`. The Celery Beat entry is kept for one cycle so a missing task name surfaces as a deployment error.
- **Event-driven metrics pipeline**: user interactions (`record_like_toggle`, `record_skip`, `record_share`, `record_telemetry` Tier-3 fallback) write to Redis via `counter_store.increment` / `add_completion` (O(1) on the request path). `flush_counters_to_pg` (every 5 min) drains the deltas and applies them to Postgres in batched UPDATEs that touch only the dirty clip set. No correlated subquery, no full-table scan. See [docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/event-driven-metrics.md](docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/event-driven-metrics.md).
- **Read replica routing**: `backend/app/db_routers.py` is a 71-line `ReadRouter` with 4 hooks (db_for_read/db_for_write/allow_relation/allow_migrate). Auto-activates when `READ_DATABASE_URL` is set; the `if not atomic and not SELECT FOR UPDATE` guard prevents stale-read races inside write transactions. See [docs/EXPLAIN/database/05-read-replica-design.md](docs/EXPLAIN/database/05-read-replica-design.md).
- **Per-session DB timeouts**: `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py` sets `statement_timeout=30s`, `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout=60s`, `lock_timeout=10s`, `connect_timeout=10s` on the default connection via libpq `options` string. Critical behind PgBouncer (25-conn pool); a slow query that held a backend connection could otherwise exhaust the pool. Gated on `ENGINE.endswith('postgresql')` so non-Postgres backends are unaffected.
- **Cache invalidation**: `services/interactions.py::invalidate_user_vectors_cache` is called from `record_like_toggle`, `record_skip`, `record_share`, and `record_telemetry`'s sync fallback via `transaction.on_commit`. The `flush_telemetry_stream` consumer invalidates each unique user's cache after a successful `bulk_create`. Stale-vector window collapsed from 15 min to near-zero for all user-state-mutating paths.
- **Counter store (event-driven, no dual-write)**: `services/counter_store.py` writes user-engagement counters to Redis (`INCRBY` for likes/shares/skips; `INCRBYFLOAT` + `INCR` for per-(user,clip) completion). The `UserInteraction.save()` F() side-effect was removed in the 2026-09 metrics rewrite; `flush_counters_to_pg` is the only path from Redis to Postgres. `ECHOFLOW_DUAL_WRITE_COUNTERS` is now a no-op (always False) and slated for deletion. See [docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/event-driven-metrics.md](docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/event-driven-metrics.md).
- **HLS output**: Stored under `media/hls/{clip_id}/` on local disk. Not S3-backed yet. `cleanup_orphan_hls` Celery task (daily 03:00 UTC) prunes directories older than 1 day that are not in the `AudioClip` table — bounded to 1000 keys/run.

## Scraping / Ingestion

The third-party scraper/import subsystem was removed for the MVP. Do not add
scraper credentials, commands, Celery tasks, or optional scraper imports back
without a new licensing and operator-review decision. The upload path owns the
rights-policy table and persists `is_noncommercial` / `requires_share_alike`
from the user's declared licence.

### Seeding media for local development
The scraper being broken does not block local media work — upload files instead.
**See [docs/EXPLAIN/operations/01-audio-upload-guide.md](docs/EXPLAIN/operations/01-audio-upload-guide.md)**
for the full guide. The essentials:

```bash
# Recommended: backend/scripts/seed_clips.py drives the real HTTP API
# (POST /clips/ -> POST /clips/{id}/approve-moderation/ -> process_audio_to_hls),
# one clip at a time. Do NOT hand-write AudioClip rows: approve-moderation is the
# only enqueue trigger, so a seeder that skips it produces a state the pipeline
# never creates and makes "the feed works" unfalsifiable.
python3 backend/scripts/seed_clips.py --dry-run   # validate the manifest, upload nothing
python3 backend/scripts/seed_clips.py             # upload + approve + wait for ready
python3 backend/scripts/seed_clips.py --resume    # skip already-uploaded tracks

# Then refill the feed so the new clips reach GET /feed/:
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local \
  exec web_local python manage.py shell -c \
  "from backend.app.tasks import refill_user_feed; print(refill_user_feed(<user_id>))"
```

Two traps the guide covers in full: `POST /clips/` enqueues **nothing**
(`finalize_upload` deliberately does not, because the task opens with an
`if not clip.moderation_approved: return` gate) — skip `approve-moderation` and
the clip sits at `processing` for ever; and `GET /feed/` is a **destructive
`lpop`**, so each call drains up to 10 ids and re-requesting a page you already
got returns the *next* ten. Buffer client-side; re-run the refill instead.

## Frontend (sample only)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server on port 5173
npm run build
```
Uses HLS.js for playback. This is an example client — the production frontend may differ.

## RevenueCat Pro Subscription Integration

EchoFlow uses **RevenueCat Billing** (Stripe-backed) for Pro subscription management. This section covers the architecture, gating strategy, and operational details.

### Architecture Overview

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Billing engine | RevenueCat Billing (Stripe) | Indian users excluded per policy |
| Subscription tier | Single "Pro" entitlement | `REVENUECAT_ENTITLEMENT_ID=pro` |
| Sync mechanism | REST API polling (Celery Beat) | Every 6h (configurable), no webhooks in Phase 1 |
| App User ID mapping | `User.uuid` (UUID4) | Immutable, survives username/email changes |
| Pro state cache | Django User model fields | `has_pro_entitlement`, `pro_expires_at`, `pro_grace_until` |
| Webhook support | Forward-compatible endpoint | HMAC-SHA256 verification gated on `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |

### Data Flow

```

### Gating Strategy: Usage Limits (Option A)

Pro gating is enforced via usage limits checked at request time — no feature flags, just hard limits:

| Feature | Free Limit | Pro Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Daily uploads | 5 clips | Unlimited |
| Max clip duration | 60 seconds | 300 seconds (MAX_DURATION_SECONDS) |
| Upload file size | 10 MB | 100 MB |
| HD quality (48kHz+) | Blocked | Allowed |
| Audio quality | 128 kbps | 320 kbps |

**Enforcement points:**
- `AudioUploadSerializer.validate()` — free-tier file size limit (before DB)
- `AudioUploadViewSet.create()` — daily upload count limit (before serializer)
- `process_audio_to_hls` task — clip duration + quality limits
- Feed views — HD quality filtering

### Grace Period Handling

During RevenueCat's billing grace period (3 days for annual/monthly), `User.is_pro()` returns `True` until the grace period ends AND the subscription is in a non-active state.

```python
def is_pro(self) -> bool:
    now = timezone.now()
    if self.has_pro_entitlement and self.pro_expires_at and self.pro_expires_at > now:
        return True
    if self.pro_grace_until and self.pro_grace_until > now:
        return True
    return False
```

The grace period end date is stored in `pro_grace_until` so Pro features continue during grace even if polling is delayed.

### Sync Strategy: REST API Polling

No webhooks in Phase 1 (free RevenueCat plan). A Celery Beat task polls the REST API every `REVENUECAT_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 360 = 6h):

```
GET https://api.revenuecat.com/v1/subscribers/{app_user_id}
```

Response parsed for:
- Active entitlements (`is_active`, `expires_date_ms`, `grace_period_expire_date_ms`)
- Updates `has_pro_entitlement`, `pro_expires_at`, `pro_grace_until`, `pro_last_synced`

If polling indicates subscription inactive AND grace period expired, `has_pro_entitlement` is set to `False`.

### Webhook Placeholder (Phase 2)

```
POST /api/v1/webhooks/revenuecat/
```

Currently returns 200 and logs payload. Full HMAC-SHA256 verification will be implemented when upgrading to RevenueCat Pro plan. The `X-RevenueCat-Signature` header is verified against `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

### Public vs Secret API Keys

| Key | Location | Safe for Frontend? |
|---|---|---|
| `REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY` | Frontend `.env` (`VITE_REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY`), backend `.env` | Yes — SDK initialization only |
| `REVENUECAT_SECRET_KEY` | Backend `.env` only | **No** — REST API polling, never expose |

### Environment Variables

All RevenueCat env vars are documented in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables-required) table above. Key production settings:

```bash
REVENUECAT_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx       # Backend-only, required
REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_xxx       # Frontend-safe
REVENUECAT_ENTITLEMENT_ID=pro
REVENUECAT_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES=360    # 6 hours
```

### Testing

- Backend: `backend/app/tests/test_revenuecat.py` — 21 tests covering `is_pro()`, `sync_entitlements`, views, webhook, free-tier limits
- Frontend: `frontend/sample_frontend/src/stores/__tests__/subscription.test.tsx` + `src/components/subscription/__tests__/Paywall.test.tsx` — 6 tests using vitest + @testing-library/react

### Operational Notes

- **Manual sync**: `POST /subscription/sync/` triggers immediate RevenueCat poll (rate-limited: 10/hour)
- **Customer Portal**: `GET /subscription/manage/` returns RevenueCat-hosted management URL
- **App User ID**: Maps to `User.uuid` (stringified). Created on user registration via `revenuecat_app_user_id` field
- **Frontend SDK init**: `Purchases.setup(publicKey, appUserId)` in `main.tsx` after auth context available
- **Paywall**: `Paywall.tsx` component shows upgrade CTA, calls `subscriptionAPI.sync()` then redirects to Customer Portal

## Testing & Linting
- Test framework: **pytest** + `pytest-django`, installed in the `api` image. Run via `docker compose exec web pytest …` — see [Running Tests](#running-tests) for the full command set.
- Test files live under `backend/app/tests/` (36 files: `test_adversarial_pass3.py`, `test_auth_regulatory.py`, `test_content_moderation.py`, `test_counter_store.py`, `test_db_router.py`, `test_erasure.py`, `test_feed_license_filter.py`, `test_feed_pool.py`, `test_group_c.py`, `test_hls_token.py`, `test_https_termination.py`, `test_integration_concurrency.py`, `test_integration_pgvector.py`, `test_metrics_endpoint.py`, `test_metrics.py`, `test_mobile_contract.py`, `test_observability_tui.py`, `test_orphan_cleanup.py`, `test_redis_url_precedence.py`, `test_reports.py`, `test_revenuecat.py`, `test_scraper_licensing.py`, `test_security_and_validation.py`, `test_sentry.py`, `test_services_comments.py`, `test_services_follows.py`, `test_services_interactions.py`, `test_services_shares.py`, `test_services_uploads.py`, `test_settings.py`, `test_share_pipeline.py`, `test_suggestions_category_filter.py`, `test_smoke.py`, `test_system_health.py`, `test_task_publisher.py`, `test_throttling.py`). The 8 `test_scraper*` files were deleted 2026-09-29 as orphaned — see the count note below.
- All tests run against PostgreSQL in Docker. No SQLite fallback.
- No linting/formatter config (no `.eslintrc` at root, no `pyproject.toml`, no `ruff.toml`).
- CI: `.github/workflows/django.yml` runs migrations + the test suite via Docker. Blocks merges on failure.
- **Current count (2026-09-30): 1257 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped, 1 xfailed.** Measured on the local stack after `a10fe14` + `f399073`, and confirmed **twice** — once with the container's `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` and once with `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`, because the compose literal was removed and the suite must not depend on it any more (see "Never gate a security guard on `DJANGO_DEBUG`" below). No `--ignore` flags are needed.
  - The 1 xfail is deliberate and load-bearing: `test_feed_and_comments_gates.py::TestCrossClipParentIsUnenforced` pins a real defect (`Comment.parent` is client-supplied and never checked against `parent.clip`, so a reply can be filed under one clip and read under another). The fix belongs in `services/comments.py` or the serializer; `strict=True` so it flips to a failure the moment someone fixes it.
  - **There are currently ZERO failing tests.** The `test_task_publisher.py::TestFlushTelemetryInvalidation` trio is green. **Two independent defects had to be fixed, in sequence** — an earlier entry in this file credited only the first, and a later one credited only the second. Both are needed to explain the history:
    1. **The patch target was inert** (fixed in `cc1b69f`). The tests patched `tasks.cache`, which `flush_telemetry_stream` never reads — it builds its own client via `redis_lib.from_url(settings.CACHES['default']['LOCATION'])` at `tasks.py:663`, inside the function. The patch succeeded while doing nothing, so the task dialled the real Redis, found `stream:interaction.events` empty, and returned `"No events to flush."` before `bulk_create` or the invalidation loop. Every assertion below the `with` block was vacuous. `cc1b69f` retargeted the patch to `redis.from_url`, which is the seam the code actually reads.
    2. **Redis was corrupt** (fixed by `redis-check-aof --fix`, same day). With the patch correctly targeted, the trio was *still* red: `echoflow_redis_cache_local` crash-looped on `Bad file format reading the append only file`, so `cache.delete` inside `invalidate_user_vectors_cache` raised, the task's `try/except` swallowed it, the key survived, and `assert cache.get(user_key) is None` failed. After the repair they pass, confirmed across two consecutive full runs.
  - **The lesson that matters more than either fix: "pre-existing failure" was doing too much work, in both directions.** Stashing my own changes proved only that *I* had not caused a failure, not that the failure was real — and an infrastructure outage that turns every cache assertion red survives that check indefinitely. Equally, a plausible root-cause story survives just as long: the `tasks.cache` analysis was *correct* and did not explain the failures I was looking at, because a second cause was underneath it. **Before diagnosing, confirm the container is healthy (`docker ps` for `Restarting`), and be suspicious of any failure that touches the cache. When a fix lands and the symptom persists, suspect a second cause before declaring the first story complete.**
  - **7 skipped** = 6 live-nginx-environmental (`TestLiveNginxTerminator` and friends need the full `docker compose up` stack, not the local one) + 1 Pillow-can't-encode-XBM skip in `test_avatar_upload.py`.
  - **Never patch a module-level name a function does not read.** `patch.object` succeeding proves the *name exists*, not that it is *used*. Grep the function body for the name before trusting a patch.
  - The previous count was **37 failed**, and AGENTS.md described them as "network/API-key dependent". **That was wrong** — none of them touched the network. They were orphaned tests left behind by `5c9c2d6 "removed scraper"`, which deleted 10 files / 407 lines including all of `ai_ml/scrapers/sources/` but touched **0** test files. The tests asserted against modules that no longer existed (`musopen`, `openverse`, `librivox`, `pixabay`, `podcast_index`, `bbc_sound_effects`, `free_music_archive`, `loc_national_jukebox`, `usgov_audio`, `youtube`, `youtube_shorts`, `state`, and the symbols `downloader.DownloadError` / `download_with_retries` / `normalizer.split_into_segments` / `uploader.save_clip_segments`). 8 test files were deleted 2026-09-29 on that basis; `test_feed_license_filter.py` was **repaired** instead of deleted because it guards a live security property.
  - **⚠ The same removal broke production code, not just tests.** `ai_ml/scrapers/base.py` no longer defines `normalize_license`, `license_features`, `license_allows_commercial`, `is_noncommercial_license`, `is_share_alike_license` or `resolve_podcast_rss` (0 definitions anywhere in the tree), yet both `backend/app/management/commands/scrape_audio.py:39` and `backend/app/tasks.py:925` (`scrape_and_import`) still import them from `ai_ml.scrapers.base`. **`scrape_audio` therefore fails at import time** — the documented scraping entry point in this file is dead until the license helpers are restored or the scraper is deleted properly. `scrape_audio.py` additionally calls `downloader.download_with_retries` (:441), `uploader.save_clip_segments` (:450) and catches `downloader.DownloadError` (:500), none of which exist any more. It also imports `ai_ml.scrapers.state` (:44) and `ai_ml.scrapers.log` (:45), two whole modules (~479 lines) that must be restored too — the 6 helpers alone are **not** enough to make it import. **⚠ The tree has TWO distinct removal commits and AGENTS.md previously credited the wrong one:** `5c9c2d6` deleted a *stripped* 10-file/407-line copy whose `base.py` never had the helpers; the real 355-line `base.py` was deleted by `aacd759`, which **also added `ai_ml/scrapers/` to `.gitignore:28` and `.dockerignore:42,57`**. Consequence: the copies on disk are **stale residue, not HEAD content**, they are invisible to git, and `.dockerignore` means they ship in **no** image — so `scrape_audio` cannot run in any container even with the imports fixed. Any restore must un-ignore the directory.
  - The **A3 licensing gate is unaffected** and still enforced: `views/feed.py` and `services/entitlements.py::is_license_restricted` read the DB columns `is_noncommercial` / `requires_share_alike`, not the missing scraper helpers. Only the scraper's ability to *classify* a license is broken. Mobile Phase 2 does not touch the scraper.
  - Still worth the discipline: compare failure **sets** across >=2 runs against a stashed baseline rather than trusting a total. Verified 2026-09-29: two consecutive runs produced byte-identical failure sets, so the numbers above are stable.
- **Root cause of 178 `auth_group does not exist` errors:** The old conftest.py used a SQLite override hack that bypassed real migrations. The fix was to make Docker/Postgres the only test environment. The new `conftest.py` auto-creates `echoflow_test` DB, installs pgvector on `template1`, and handles session teardown.
- **docker-compose.test.yml** — test-only stack (db, redis, minio, web). No nginx, no celery workers. Run with: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build -d` then `docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app web pytest backend/app/tests/ --tb=short`.
- **Recent fixes (2026-09-07):**
  - **`backend/app/migrations/0002_audioclip_cover_image.py`** (added) — the `AudioClip.cover_image` field was added to the model (line 85) but the migration was never generated, so every `INSERT INTO app_audioclip` failed with `column "cover_image" of relation "app_audioclip" does not exist`. The migration was generated by `manage.py makemigrations` and added to fix 73 cascading fixture-setup errors across `test_adversarial_pass3.py`, `test_counter_store.py`, `test_orphan_cleanup.py`, `test_security_and_validation.py`, `test_services_{comments,interactions,shares,uploads}.py`, `test_task_publisher.py`, and `test_integration_{concurrency,pgvector}.py`.
  - **`ai_ml/scrapers/uploader.py:17`** (fixed) — was `from ..models import AudioClip` (a relative import left over from when the scraper lived at `backend/app/scrapers/uploader.py`); changed to the absolute `from backend.app.models import AudioClip` to match the pattern used by every other `ai_ml/` file. Was causing `ImportError: cannot import name 'AudioClip' from 'ai_ml.models'` in `test_scraper.py::test_uploader_creates_audioclip`.
  - **`docker/postgres-init/`** (new directory) — three init SQL scripts that run on the main `db` service's first startup: `00-init-pgvector.sql` installs the extension in `POSTGRES_DB` (echoflow_db) so Django migrations can find it; `01-init-pgvector-template1.sql` runs `\c template1` then installs the extension on the template (CRITICAL — must run after `00-` so `template1` has vector before `02-` runs); `02-echoflow-test-db.sql` runs `CREATE DATABASE echoflow_test OWNER echoflow` (idempotent via `\gexec` + `WHERE NOT EXISTS` guard). Filename ordering is load-bearing — see "Postgres init scripts" below.
  - **`docker-compose.yml:11-22`** (modified) — the `db` service now mounts `./docker/postgres-init` (instead of just the old `docker/test/postgres-init/init-pgvector.sql` single file) at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro`. The single-file mount only installed vector in `echoflow_db`; the directory mount provisions both `echoflow_db` (main) and `echoflow_test` (dev) with pgvector on a fresh data volume. The separate `docker-compose.test.yml` still uses `./docker/test/postgres-init` for its own dedicated test-db container (clean isolation from dev data).
- **Audit records the proxy IP, not the client (fixed 2026-09-29)**: nginx is the only entrypoint, so `REMOTE_ADDR` is the nginx container's address. `CorrelationIdMiddleware` used `REMOTE_ADDR or X-Forwarded-For` — the `or` fallback could never fire behind the terminator, so every `AuditLog` row recorded `172.29.0.x`; `ConsentAudit` used `REMOTE_ADDR` alone. Verified live: `AuditLog.ip_address` held `172.29.0.13`. Both now use `EchoFlow/client_ip.py::get_client_ip`, which prefers `X-Real-IP` (nginx **sets** it from `$remote_addr`, so it cannot be spoofed through the terminator). Do **not** put `X-Forwarded-For` first: nginx uses `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`, which *appends*, so the first entry is whatever the client sent.
- **Postgres init scripts:** the main `db` service runs `docker/postgres-init/*.sql` in alphabetical order on first startup of a fresh data volume. The load-bearing order is `00-` (default DB) → `01-` (template1) → `02-` (create test db). If you change a filename, re-read the dependency comments in each file or you will silently break `CREATE DATABASE` for `echoflow_test` (vector extension is required on the source template). Wipe the volume (`docker volume rm echoflow_postgres_data`) if you change an init script — init scripts only run on a fresh data directory.
- **HNSW index EXPLAIN test gotcha:** `SET LOCAL enable_seqscan = OFF` requires an active transaction. Wrap it in `transaction.atomic()` to ensure it takes effect. Also verify the index type via `pg_am.amname` as a primary check (not just the EXPLAIN plan, which may choose Seq Scan for small tables).
- **S3 storage in tests:** Use `default_storage.exists(clip.original_file.name)` instead of `os.path.exists(clip.original_file.path)` — `.path` raises `NotImplementedError` on S3 storage backends (MinIO).
- **Conditional skip pattern for system binaries:** Use `@unittest.skipUnless(_ffmpeg_available, "requires ffmpeg on PATH")` where `_ffmpeg_available = shutil.which('ffmpeg') is not None`. This passes in Docker (ffmpeg installed) and skips on bare-metal dev.
- **F() expressions for atomic updates in concurrency tests:** Use `F('likes') + 1` instead of read-modify-write patterns (`obj.likes = obj.likes + 1`) to avoid race conditions.
- **date() objects for DOB fields:** Use `date(1990, 1, 1)` instead of string literals for date fields to avoid type errors.
- **trigger_hls_processing vs finalize_upload:** The upload flow changed; use `trigger_hls_processing` instead of the old `finalize_upload` in test fixtures.
- **cache import in adversarial tests:** Some test files need `from django.core.cache import cache` to work with Django's test cache backend.
- **postgresql assertion in smoke tests:** Changed from `sqlite3` to `postgresql` in smoke test assertions to match the Docker-only test environment.

### Known Skipped / Disabled Tests (environmental, not regressions)

The following test is **conditionally skipped** with `@unittest.skipUnless(_ffmpeg_available, ...)` because it requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. The `api` Docker image already installs ffmpeg (in the `base` stage of the Dockerfile), so this test **passes in Docker**. If running on a bare-metal dev machine without ffmpeg, it will be skipped:

| Test | Reason | How to enable locally |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| `backend/app/tests/test_scraper.py::ScraperUnitTests::test_normalizer_trims_to_max_seconds` | Requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH` (used by `pydub` for MP3 export) | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Debian/Ubuntu/Pop!_OS) or `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) |

> The second scraper test, `test_uploader_creates_audioclip`, was previously ffmpeg-conditional too but now runs (it was failing with `ImportError` due to a broken relative import; the import was fixed in 2026-09 — see "Recent fixes" below).

The following nginx HTTPS termination tests require the `nginx` container (not part of the test stack):

| Test | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `backend/app/tests/test_https_termination.py::TestNginxConfig::test_nginx_parses_with_no_errors` | Requires `nginx` on `PATH` (only in the full Docker stack) |
| `backend/app/tests/test_https_termination.py::TestLiveNginxTerminator::*` | Live HTTP/HTTPS requests against nginx (not in test stack) |

These use `@unittest.skip(...)` for nginx (binary not available) and the full `docker compose up` stack for the live terminator tests. They pass when running the full stack.

If you add a test that needs a system binary not present in the Docker image, follow the same pattern: `@unittest.skip("requires <binary> on PATH; see AGENTS.md")`.

**Do NOT** comment-out or remove tests that fail for reasons you don't understand. If a test fails and the cause is unclear, debug it: run with `pytest --tb=long`, read the traceback, search the codebase for the operation being tested, and check whether the test environment matches the AGENTS.md prerequisites (Python 3.11, Postgres 16, Redis 7, FFmpeg on `PATH`, `docker compose` running). Only after you understand WHY a test fails — and the cause is environmental, not a code bug — should you add a skip with a clear reason.

### Local `.env` discipline

- `.env` is **gitignored**. Do not commit it. The boilerplate is `.env.example`, `.env.vps.example`, and `.env.laptop.example`; copy one of those to `.env` and edit locally. The `.gitignore` allows committing `*.example` files (see `.gitignore` exception rules for `.env.*.example`).
- Tracked env files must have `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`. CI runs `scripts/check_no_tracked_env.sh` on every PR; a tracked env file with `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` will block the merge.
- `HF_TOKEN` and `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` in your local `.env` are real secrets. If you accidentally commit them, rotate them immediately.

### Where decisions and lessons live

**Design decisions** (architecture, schema, API, security, deployment) go in `docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — NOT in AGENTS.md. Append new decisions there and link from AGENTS.md only if the decision changes how the stack is operated.

**Session lessons learnt** (gotchas, failure modes, test gaps) stay in AGENTS.md under [Session Learnings](#session-learnings--known-things) below — keep each entry to a tight bullet, max 3 lines.

**DOs and DON'Ts** (from user corrections) accumulate in AGENTS.md under [DOs and DON'Ts](#dos-and-donts). When the user corrects a behavior, append the lesson here on your own — do not ask, just update.

AGENTS.md is checked into the repo and is the canonical quick-start for coding agents. Update it when you:
- add or change a required env var,
- change the test command (e.g., new PYTHONPATH requirement),
- move a major subsystem (e.g., a Celery task, a service, a queue),
- learn a lesson worth keeping.

Keep entries concise. Link to docs instead of inlining long explanations.

## Gotchas
- `DEBUG = True` is hardcoded in `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py:15` — env-driven override exists (`DJANGO_DEBUG=False`). **MUST be `False` once the nginx terminator is live**, otherwise `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` 301-loops on the in-container `/health/` probe (the in-container healthcheck now sends `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` to compensate; the regression test `test_in_container_healthcheck_must_send_forwarded_proto` enforces this).
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is env-driven (`DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost`). Add your host IP if accessing via LAN/Tailscale.
- `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True` in settings.py is hardcoded — env override (`DJANGO_CORS_ALL`) exists but the code sets it to True after the env check. With the terminator live, leave `DJANGO_CORS_ALL=False` and enumerate `https://...` origins explicitly.
- `requirements.txt` lists `librosa` twice (lines 8 and 28) — harmless but sloppy.
- `backend/scripts/seed_db.py` targets port 8005 (Docker) not 8000 (dev server). Adjust `API_ENDPOINT` if running locally. After the terminator: `https://localhost/clips/`.
- `backend/wait_for_db.py` polls the database with exponential backoff (up to 120
  attempts); relies on `DATABASE_URL` being set and resolvable in the
  Compose network.
- `process_audio_to_hls` is enqueued via `transaction.on_commit` in `backend/app/views.py:112` — won't fire if the transaction rolls back.
- Comment count on `AudioClip` is denormalized and updated in `Comment.save()/delete()` — not via signals.
- `UserInteraction` uses `F()` expressions for atomic counter increments on likes/shares/skips.
- **Self-signed dev cert (`docker/certs/localhost.crt`) is in the repo on purpose** so a fresh clone works. For prod, replace with Let's Encrypt material and `nginx -s reload` — the cert is bind-mounted, so no rebuild is needed. **Do NOT push the dev key to a public registry in any fork that re-publishes the image**; revocation is the only fix.
- **HLS token cookies**: The `ef_hls_token` cookie must have `SameSite=Lax` (not `Strict`) so it's sent on top-level navigation from `app.echoflow.in` to `media.echoflow.in` (SameSite=Lax permits cookies on same-site top-level navigations, but blocks cross-site). `Secure` requires HTTPS on both `api.echoflow.in` and `media.echoflow.in`. In dev, `Domain` attribute must be empty (localhost doesn't support domain cookies). See `docs/EXPLAIN/storage/04-hls-token-protection.md`.
- **HLS token secret sync**: In production, `MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET` must be **identical** in the VPS `.env` (Django issuance) and the Cloudflare Worker secret (`npx wrangler secret put MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET`). If these diverge, all HLS playback returns 403.
- **RFC 3986 §5.2.2 — Signed URLs don't work for HLS**: The master playlist references variant playlists and segments via relative paths. RFC 3986 §5.2.2 strips query strings during relative-reference resolution, so signed URLs (which rely on query parameters) fail on the second and subsequent HLS requests. **Signed cookies (or an equivalent per-prefix credential) are the only viable token mechanism for HLS.** This applies to any multi-file streaming protocol (HLS, DASH, Smooth Streaming).
- **fetch `credentials: 'include'` for Set-Cookie**: When using `fetch()` to call an endpoint that sets an HttpOnly cookie via `Set-Cookie`, the fetch request **must** include `credentials: 'include'` (or `'same-origin'`). Without it, the browser silently discards the Set-Cookie header. This is a common gotcha when building token-issuance endpoints.
- **HLS token has TWO transports — cookie (web) and header (native)**: `POST /media/playback-token/<clip_id>/` (POST, not GET — minting a credential must not be a safe/prefetchable/cacheable method) returns `{"status": "ok"}` and always sets the `ef_hls_token` cookie. A caller that also sends **`X-EchoFlow-Client: native`** additionally receives `"token"` in the body, and the Worker then accepts it as the **`X-EchoFlow-Media-Token`** request header (cookie-first precedence).
  - **Web:** read nothing from the body. The cookie is HttpOnly and the browser attaches it to every `/hls/*` request.
  - **Native (React Native / Expo):** send the header. AVPlayer does not read `NSHTTPCookieStorage` and ExoPlayer's `DefaultHttpDataSource` sends no `Cookie` header, so neither shares state with the app's HTTP client — and the cookie is `HttpOnly`+`Secure`, so the app cannot read it back to attach it manually. Attach the token via the player's per-source `headers` (expo-audio applies them to the manifest *and* every segment). See `docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/2026-09-28-native-media-auth-and-cgnat-throttling.md`.
  - The body token is **opt-in** and the default body is unchanged, because `HttpOnly` exists to stop script from reading a bearer credential. Both transports carry the same HMAC string; signature, `exp` and per-clip scope are enforced identically.
  - **Cookie-first precedence will fool you when testing with `requests`.** `playback-token` sets `ef_hls_token` with `path=/hls/`, so a `requests.Session` that has *ever* minted a token will silently attach the cookie to `/hls/*` and a "no token" probe returns **200/206, not 403**. That is the cookie working, not a bypass. To test the header transport, `session.cookies.clear()` first, or use a fresh session. Verified 2026-09-29: 403 (no credential) → 206 (cookie) → 403 (cleared) → 200 (header only).
- **Bind-mounted source ≠ reloaded process**: the local stack bind-mounts the repo at `/app`, so a Python edit is on disk instantly — but gunicorn imported the module at startup and does not re-read it. Editing a view then curling the running stack exercises the OLD code, while pytest (fresh import) passes and `grep` in the container shows the new code. **Restart `web_local` before trusting any curl against a Python change.** `wrangler dev` does not have this problem.
- **…and the three workers do not even see the edit** (2026-09-29): `celery_media_local` / `celery_feed_local` / `celery_beat_local` have **no `/app` bind mount at all** — they run the image baked at build time, so a `backend/` fix needs `docker build` or a `docker cp` **plus a restart** (the prefork parent holds the old bytecode; copying the file while it runs changes nothing). `web_local` and `celery_local` are bind-mounted and only need a restart. Check `docker inspect <svc> --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{.Destination}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | grep /app` before assuming an edit took effect.
- **A stale `REDIS_BROKER_URL` in `.env.local` silently wins over compose's `REDIS_BROKER_HOST` (fixed 2026-09-29)**: the assignment was `os.getenv("REDIS_BROKER_URL", build_redis_url("REDIS_BROKER"))`, so an old URL in the env file beat the service name compose had just set — defeating the HOST/PORT split that exists *because* base64 Redis passwords break Kombo URL parsing. Symptom is nasty and misdiagnosable: the local stack publishes to a broker owned by the **other** compose project, two independent codebases race for the same `celery` queue, and a brand-new task dies with `NotRegistered` about half the time (measured **2/6**). It looks like "Celery never runs my task". `resolve_redis_url()` now prefers `{prefix}_HOST`; all three `.env.*.example` templates set exactly one form, so none of them change. If a new task mysteriously never fires, check this first.
- **A stale `django-redis` connection 500s, it does not 503**: `ConnectionInterrupted` out of the throttle check turns `POST /auth/login/` into a 500 debug page. Transient, clears on retry — re-run before investigating.
- **Never construct a media URL client-side**: use `hls_playlist_url` verbatim. Do not prefix the API base onto it — the HLS origin is the edge (`PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL`), often a different host and port from the API, and in `edge` style it is bucket-less. Both existing frontends did this and it is wrong; see `docs/FRONTEND-REQUIREMENTS.md` §4.7.
- **IP-keyed throttling is wrong on a mobile network**: a carrier NAT gateway is thousands of callers. `POST /auth/token/refresh/` is keyed on the **verified `user_id` inside the refresh token** (`RefreshTokenRateThrottle`), not the address — otherwise 15-minute access tokens mean ~4 refreshes/hour/user and one cell exhausts its shared `anon` budget, logging out every subscriber. `POST /auth/register/` keeps an IP key (it is anonymous) but is sized at 200/hour and paired with a per-username limit at 3/hour.
- **`throttle_scope` is load-bearing on any `ScopedRateThrottle` view**: `ScopedRateThrottle` reads its scope from the *view* at request time and **allows everything** when the view does not declare one. Listing the class without `throttle_scope` is a silent no-op — no error, no rate limit. `TestRefreshThrottleWiring` in `test_throttling.py` exists to catch exactly that.

## Engineering Principles

The following principles govern all code changes. These are standard SWE best practices distilled from the full protocol:

**Truth Protocol:** Source code > migrations > tests > config > docs > comments. Never invent behavior to reconcile conflicts; investigate instead.

**Golden Rules:**
- Understand before changing; root-cause fixes over symptoms
- Minimal viable changes; no "while I'm here" cleanup
- Never add a dependency without checking it exists in the repo first
- Tests are part of the implementation; don't delete/weaken/skip without justification
- Get approval before architecture/API/schema/security/deployment changes
- Design for failure: retries, idempotency, race conditions, partial completion

**Git Safety:** Use a dedicated branch. Never `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, or `git push --force` without explicit authorization.

**Documentation:** Put repo-specific notes in `docs/EXPLAIN/`. Use `DECISION:` / `SECURITY:` / `HACK:` / `TODO:` tags in code.

**For complex tasks touching approval gates (architecture, APIs, schemas, auth, security, deployment):**
Produce a design doc at `docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with Changes Needed, How Changes Will Be Made, Why This & Not Anything Else, Files Affected, Architecture & Data Flow, Test Cases, Edge Cases, Atomic Commit Plan. Get explicit approval before implementing.

## Distributed-System & Security Reminders

When changing distributed workflows (Django, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, Celery, MinIO/S3, FFmpeg/HLS, ML workers), consider: duplicate execution, retries, idempotency, race conditions, ordering, stale data, worker failure, process restart, partial completion, timeouts, resource exhaustion, network failure.

Never assume a task runs exactly once unless the system guarantees it. For every retryable operation, ask whether repeating it is safe.

**Media and Storage Invariants:** original uploads live in object storage; HLS output is generated in local worker scratch space then uploaded; containers must not assume a shared filesystem; HLS playback uses token-gated `hls/` paths (signed cookies); original `uploads/` remain private (signed S3 URLs); local scratch files must be cleaned up after processing. Verify in `settings.py`, `media_urls.py`, `tasks.py`, `docker-compose.yml` before modifying.

**Security:** Never hardcode secrets. Treat all input as untrusted. Validate/sanitize at boundaries. Before changing security-sensitive code, consider auth, authorization, injection, SSRF, path traversal, command execution, secret leakage, sensitive-data exposure, race conditions. For DB changes, inspect migrations, existing data, locking, rollback, compatibility.

## Session Learnings & Known Things

Durable, repo-specific knowledge. Append a concise entry at the end of each session.

### 2026-09-15 — local-stack-compose-fixes + hybrid-deployment-diagnostics
**Learned:**
- MinIO image tags `RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z` don't exist on Docker Hub → change to `quay.io/minio/minio:latest`; same for `mc:latest`
- Locally-built images (`echoflow-api:local`, `echoflow-media:local`, `echoflow/pgbouncer:local`) require `pull_policy: never` in docker-compose to avoid pulling from non-existent Docker Hub repos
- Redis passwords with base64 chars (`+`, `/`, `=`) break Kombu URL parsing → split into `REDIS_*_HOST/PORT/PASSWORD` env vars + `build_redis_url()` helper in `settings.py`
- `docker/nginx.conf` uses `web:8000`/`minio:9000` upstreams but local services are `web_local`/`minio_local` → create `docker/nginx.local.conf` with corrected hostnames
- Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK for `api` stage is web probe (`localhost:8000/health/`), not Celery → override healthcheck in compose with `celery inspect ping` for worker services
- `minio_init_local` service auto-initializes MinIO bucket on first stack up but `quay.io/minio/mc:latest` may have version incompatibility with MinIO server; service exits after init (one-shot behavior)
- Orphan container `echoflow_revnuecat-prod-celery_media-1` from previous project config is NOT part of current stack; use `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to clean
- Laptop media worker (`docker-compose.laptop.yml`) uses Tailscale tunnel to VPS, NOT Docker bridge; requires `tailscale up --accept-routes`, IP forwarding on both devices, and VPS nftables rule `ip saddr <laptop-ts-ip> iifname "tailscale0" accept` for TCP to work (ICMP/ping may work without it)

**Changed:**
- `docker-compose.local.yml`: fixed image tags, pull policies, Redis URLs, nginx upstreams, celery healthcheck, removed/re-added minio_init_local
- `docker/nginx.local.conf`: new file with corrected upstream hostnames
- `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py`: added `build_redis_url()` function
- Verified all 13 local services healthy; health endpoint `curl -k https://localhost:18443/health/` works

**Open:**
- `TestLiveNginxTerminator` fix (probe response body) - tracked in AGENTS.md
- `makemigrations --check` in CI - tracked in AGENTS.md

### 2026-09-28 — local-hls-worker + local-stack-networking
**Learned:**
- An R2 *binding* cannot be pointed at MinIO: under `wrangler dev` it is miniflare's local blob store in `.wrangler/state/` and `get()` always returns `null`. `workers/hls-token-worker/src/storage.ts` now selects an S3-over-fetch backend when `MEDIA_S3_ENDPOINT` is set. workerd CAN reach host-published MinIO and honours `Range`.
- A hand-rolled SigV4 was wrong twice, in OPPOSITE directions, and both passed every self-written test: it used `sha256("")` where boto3/MinIO want the literal `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`, and it put the access key id in the string-to-sign scope (it belongs only in `X-Amz-Credential`). Both surfaced only as 403 from MinIO. **Use `aws4fetch`** — a self-consistent signer validates only itself.
- `minio_local` is not a legal RFC 1123 hostname. `mc:latest` says `Invalid Request (invalid hostname)` and botocore 1.43 says `ValueError: Invalid endpoint`, so the bucket was never created and Django could not reach storage at all. Fixed with a hyphenated `minio-local` network alias.
- A top-level `networks:` block in compose does NOT auto-attach services — they go to the implicit `default`. Naming the block `default` is what makes an explicit bridge/subnet take effect. And `bridge.name: br-echoflow-local` was 17 chars vs Linux's 15-char limit, which Docker reports as the very unhelpful `numerical result out of range`.
- wrangler does NOT hot-reload `.dev.vars` (source files only). `scripts/run-hls-worker-local.sh` regenerates it from `.env.local` on every run so the two secrets cannot drift, and `npm run dev` routes through it.
- `conftest.py` hardcoded host `db`/port `5432`/`echoflow_test`, so the suite errored at setup everywhere except the main stack (`could not translate host name "db"`). Now env-driven via `DB_HOST`/`DB_PORT`/`TEST_DB_HOST`/`TEST_DB_PORT`/`TEST_DB_NAME`. `DATABASE_URL` is built by compose from those — it cannot live in the env file, since compose does not expand `${...}` there.
- `PlaybackTokenView` had zero test coverage despite being the token issuer. `test_hls_token.py` + `test_https_termination.py`: 69 passed, 6 skipped.
- `test_https_listeners_present` passes **vacuously** — its regex matches the commented-out `listen 9443 ssl` in `docker/nginx.conf`. `TestLocalHlsWorkerRouting` reads the local config, where the block is real.

**Changed:**
- `docker-compose.local.yml`, `docker/nginx.local.conf`, `conftest.py`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.test.yml`
- `workers/hls-token-worker/`: new `src/storage.ts` + tests, `/healthz`, `aws4fetch` dep, `.dev.vars.example`
- `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py`, `backend/app/media_urls.py`, `backend/app/views/media.py`
- New: `scripts/run-hls-worker-local.sh`, `docs/EXPLAIN/storage/05-local-hls-worker-runbook.md`, `docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/2026-09-28-local-hls-worker.md`

**Open:**
- **No cross-environment parity test**: the R2 backend (prod) and S3 backend (local) never see the same input. Token validation is shared code so the security boundary is covered; the storage fetch is not.
- `docker-compose.test.yml` cannot start — `docker-compose.yml` references `minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z`, which does not exist on Docker Hub. Blocks running the suite in the documented test stack.
- 4 failures at the time, unrelated to this work: `test_task_publisher.py::TestFlushTelemetryInvalidation` (3) and `test_feed_license_filter.py::test_fallback_excludes_nc_and_sa` (1). None of those files are in this branch's diff. Historical note: the 3 telemetry failures were the corrupt-Redis incident, not code.
- 8 scraper test modules error on `ai_ml.scrapers.state`, deleted in `5c9c2d6 "removed scraper"` while `scrape_audio.py` and the tests still import it.
- `celery_media_local` OOMs (2 GB limit, 12 GB host), so HLS output is not produced locally; fixtures are seeded into MinIO directly.

---

### 2026-09-28 — mobile-rebuild: native media auth + CGNAT throttling
**Learned:**
- `ef_hls_token` is unreachable for native players: AVPlayer/ExoPlayer have no shared cookie jar, and the cookie is `HttpOnly`+`Secure`. Fixed by an opt-in `X-EchoFlow-Client: native` body token + Worker `X-EchoFlow-Media-Token` header (cookie-first precedence — a page can set a header but cannot read the cookie). `docs/mobile-rebuild-plan.md` §2-3.
- `ScopedRateThrottle` reads its scope from the **view** and allows *everything* when absent. Listing the class on a view with no `throttle_scope` silently unthrottles it — no error. `throttle_scope` is load-bearing.
- simplejwt **stringifies** `user_id` (`tokens.py:228`), so `isinstance(x, int)` on the token subject always fails; accept `(str, int)` or the throttle silently falls back to IP keying.
- `AnonRateThrottle` is fatal on mobile: 100/hour/IP behind a carrier NAT, and 15-min access tokens mean every user refreshes ~4x/hour → mass logout. Key refresh on the verified token subject, not the address.
- `.env.vps.example` was missing `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL`, so prod emitted bucket-prefixed HLS URLs the Worker 404s. Domain is `echoflow.in` (was split with `echo-flow.in` across 13 files).

**Changed:**
- `backend/app/throttling.py` (new), `views/media.py`, `views/auth.py`, `app/urls.py`, `settings.py`; `workers/hls-token-worker/src/{token,index}.ts`; `.env.vps.example`, 3 compose files; 11 docs.
- New tests: `test_throttling.py` (26), `token.test.ts` (8), `TestNativeTokenTransport` (9).

**Open:**
- **No phone dev loop.** `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` is hardcoded to `localhost:19443` (a phone's `localhost` is the phone) and `docker/certs/localhost.crt` does not cover a LAN IP. Cert setup is manual per owner decision; runbook section not yet written.
- Suite flakiness: `test_counter_store` / `test_revenuecat` / `test_services_interactions` fail non-deterministically under a contended stack and pass in isolation. Compare failure **sets** across >=2 runs vs a stashed baseline; a single run proves nothing.
- Mobile app itself is **not started** — the rewrite plan is `docs/mobile-rebuild-plan.md` §8-17. Backend items still blocking feature parity are tabulated in §17.

---

### 2026-09-29 — mobile Phase 2: real-media seed + four latent bugs
**Learned:**
- **`celery_media_local`, `celery_feed_local` and `celery_beat_local` run a BAKED image with no `/app` bind mount** (only `web_local` and `celery_local` bind-mount the repo). Any `backend/` edit is invisible to them until a rebuild or a `docker cp`. This is the same trap as the existing "bind-mounted source ≠ reloaded process" note, one level worse: not a stale process, a stale *image*.
- **A stale `REDIS_BROKER_URL` in `.env.local` (172.28.0.x) beat compose's `REDIS_BROKER_HOST`** because those three workers predate the 2026-09-29 `resolve_redis_url` fix. They published Celery tasks to a dead broker while `web_local` published to the live one — so uploads enqueued and then nothing ran. The 2026-09-29 fix is correct; it just had not reached the baked images. Fix: delete `REDIS_BROKER_URL` / `REDIS_CACHE_URL` from `.env.local` and let HOST/PORT win.
- **Orphan containers from another project can silently consume your queue.** `echoflow_revnuecat-prod-celery_media-1` was up 23h on `-Q heavy_media` against the same broker, stealing every `process_audio_to_hls` task. It presented as "the worker receives 0 tasks". Check `docker ps -a | grep -v <your project>` and decode a `LINDEX` of the queue to see whose clip IDs are in there.
- **`from ..services` in `backend/app/tasks.py` killed EVERY HLS encode** at the moderation step (`ModuleNotFoundError: backend.services`). `tasks.py` is at `backend/app/`, so it needs `.services`; only files a level deeper use `..services`. Nothing had HLS'd successfully before this.

**Changed:**
- `backend/app/tasks.py` (import), `backend/app/views/content.py` + `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py` + `backend/app/tests/test_throttling.py` (throttle scopes), `backend/scripts/seed_clips.py` (new), `docker-compose.local.yml` (media worker concurrency 2→1), 8 deleted orphaned `test_scraper*` files, `backend/app/tests/test_feed_license_filter.py` (repaired).
- Commits: `7e39e52` (import), `936de67` (throttle scopes), `6b3da27` (seed + compose).
- Decision: `docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/2026-09-29-clip-throttle-scopes.md`.

**Open:**
- **`scrape_audio` and the `scrape_and_import` task are dead at import time** — both import license helpers that no longer exist in `ai_ml/scrapers/base.py`. Not touched by mobile Phase 2; needs a decision (restore helpers or delete the scraper properly).
- **`test_task_publisher.py::TestFlushTelemetryInvalidation` (3) — were red, now green, and never a code defect.** The long "inert patch target" analysis was wrong; the real cause was the corrupt-Redis incident. See Testing & Linting.
- Media worker image still needs a rebuild for the `task.py` import fix to be permanent; currently `docker cp`'d in.

---

### 2026-09-29 — frontend-rebuild-pass-1 (harness, avatar bound, is_following)
**Learned:**
- **Read the model before "fixing" a validation gap.** `profile_picture` is `models.ImageField` (`models.py:55`), so DRF already runs Pillow's real `ImageField` decode — the avatar upload was never missing content checks, only a size cap. I wrote a magic-byte allowlist to mirror the audio path, then deleted it: strictly weaker than an actual decode. `_BLOCKED_MAGIC_SIGNATURES` exists for *audio* because audio has many valid headers; an avatar has three. Always check whether the framework already covers the layer.
- **`ImageField` sets no size limit, and `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` does not apply** — uploads spool to temp files. That was the entire real gap in B1.
- **Test fixtures must be the thing the test is about.** A flat-colour 1400×1400 PNG is **9 KB, not 6 MB** (needs incompressible random pixels to reach a byte cap), and a synthetic `\x89PNG` header tests Pillow's rejection of garbage rather than the size/extension rule. Assert the fixture's own size/content.
- **Which DRF layer fires is not inferable from the error text** — a bad extension with non-image content reports `invalid_image`, not `invalid_extension`. Assert the outcome, or the test measures the wrong layer and passes for the wrong reason.
- **Check `is_authenticated`, not truthiness, on `request.user`.** DRF hands unauthenticated requests a truthy `AnonymousUser`; `if viewer is None` raised `AttributeError: 'AnonymousUser' object has no attribute 'following'`.
- **N+1 tests measure the whole serializer, not your field.** "0 queries over 10 clips" returned 20 — from pre-existing `creator_name` (FK walk, no `select_related`) and `is_liked` (my queryset skipped that annotation). Isolate your contribution: annotate the neighbours, then add a second test omitting only one of them. **Both N+1s are still live (P2, logged in `docs/frontend_rebuild_plan.md`).**
- **A corrupt AOF makes every cache-backed test fail as a DNS error and silently masks real results.** `echoflow_redis_cache_local` crash-looped on `Bad file format reading the append only file`; `socket.gethostbyname` fails while the container restarts, so failures read as flaky-connection rather than infrastructure. `docker ps` → `Restarting` is the tell. Non-destructive fix: `docker run --rm -i -v <volume>:/data redis:7-alpine redis-check-aof --fix /data/appendonlydir/appendonly.aof.1.incr.aof` (answer `y`), then `docker compose rm -sf` + `up -d` the service.
- **`GET /profile/me/` was a 500 for every user and no test covered it.** `UserInteraction.clip` declares no `related_name` (`models.py:256`), so the reverse accessor is `userinteraction`, and `get_liked_clips`' `interactions__*` filter raised `FieldError`. Found only because B2 added a field to a serializer that could not render. **Untested endpoints are broken endpoints — assert 200 on each, not just on the fields under test.**

**Changed:** commits `4ed5cf5` (vitest/RTL harness, `strict`, ErrorBoundary), `9eebc1a` (avatar size+extension bound, B1), `21846fe` (`is_following`, B2 + the `userinteraction` fix). Plan: `docs/frontend_rebuild_plan.md`. Suite 586 → **702 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped** after Block 0 (the `TestFlushTelemetryInvalidation` trio is green; it was never a code defect — see Testing & Linting).

**Open:**
- Commits 4–11 of the plan: fabricated-`receiver_id` share writes (live data corruption), `watch_time_ms` = media position (ranking exploit), dead auto-advance, and the `ef_session_expired` gap. **The share bug is the most urgent item in the repo.**
- Two live N+1s on every feed page: `creator_name` needs `select_related('creator')`, `is_liked` needs the `user_has_liked` annotation. Neither is in the plan's commit list.

---

### 2026-09-29 — frontend-rebuild Block 0: four live Criticals closed
**Learned:**
- **A comment describing a method that does not exist is worse than no comment.** `CORS_URLS_REGEX = r'$.^'` disabled CORS for the entire API, justified by "the middleware will still apply CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to all responses that flow through its `check_origin` method". `CorsMiddleware` has no `check_origin`; `is_enabled` is `re.match(...) or check_signal(...)` and `check_signal` fires a signal nothing subscribes to. Production is cross-origin by design (Pages `app.echoflow.in` → `api.echoflow.in`), so the deployed app could not have made a single browser request. **Same pattern as `ErrorBoundary.tsx:28`**, which claims it sits inside the providers when it sits outside. Grep for the symbol the comment names.
- **An exact-match placeholder blocklist is not a guard.** The empty-only `MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET` check let `change-me-to-a-long-random-string` — committed to this repo, shipped in all three env examples — become the production HMAC key. Substring matching plus a `<...>` template-marker rule is the shape that actually holds. A whitespace-only value is truthy and also slipped through.
- **A share token is a 30-day media token.** `validatePlaybackToken` (worker `token.ts:106`) checks format/HMAC/version/expiry/scope and cannot tell a share token from a media one, and the token rides in the URL (`?s=`). So a **play-time** gate is bypassable: hand the raw token over and hit the edge directly. Mint-time refusal is the only load-bearing control.
- **A `ShareEvent` is a capability, not a record.** `resolve_clip_access` grants `ACCESS_SHARED_WITH_ME` and returns *before* the licence check by design. So an unscoped `send_share` (it was `get_object_or_404(AudioClip, pk=pk)`, with **zero** tests) chained into the NC/SA bypass in two requests. Copy the feed's own predicate rather than writing a second "what is servable" filter — two of them drift.
- **"Pre-existing failure" can be pure infrastructure.** The 3 `TestFlushTelemetryInvalidation` failures were the corrupt-AOF incident, not code; the long "inert patch target" analysis in this file was wrong. Stashing my changes proved *I* hadn't caused them, not that they were real. Check `docker ps` for `Restarting` before diagnosing anything cache-shaped.
- **Changing `.env.local` does nothing until the container is recreated.** `up -d web_local` is required or every test reads a stale secret. Caught only because a green result looked wrong.

**Changed:** `cfc5bc1` (CORS), `c897426` (placeholder secret), `3042f20` (A4 licence gate), `74c7ac9` (`send_share` scope), `fcc380d` (pricing-gap handover doc). New tests: `test_cors.py` (24), `TestPlaceholderSecretRejected` (18), 8 in `test_share_pipeline.py`, `test_share_send_endpoint.py` (14, the file that did not exist). Suite 614 → **702 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped**.

**Every new test was verified to FAIL against the unpatched code** (14/24, 13/18, 7/8, 7/14 respectively) by reverting the fix and re-running. A test that has never been seen red is not evidence.

**Open:**
- ~~`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_*_PASSWORD` ship the same placeholders and are **not** guarded~~ — **CLOSED 2026-09-30 in `a10fe14`.** The predicate moved to `backend/EchoFlow/secrets.py` (shared with `hls_token.py` instead of imported from it, which was a layering inversion) and now guards `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` and both Redis passwords at settings-import time. Three bypasses exist and all three are documented: the exact-value `ECHOFLOW_ALLOW_PLACEHOLDER_SECRETS=1`, `DJANGO_DEBUG=true`, and `secrets.testing_enabled()`. `DB_PASSWORD` is still unguarded **by design** — `settings.py` never reads it (compose interpolation only), so there is nowhere to guard it; it is a compose-level concern.
- `.env.example` has 9 duplicated keys; `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` appears 3× and last-wins downgrades `change-me-...` to `admin-password`.
- `SENTRY_DSN` absent from `.env.vps.example`; `celery_beat_local` has `healthcheck: {disable: true}` so it reads `Up` forever while crash-looping.
- `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` was unset locally, which silently routed HLS URLs to private MinIO past the validating edge. Now set — **the Worker must be running (`scripts/run-hls-worker-local.sh`) or nginx returns 502**, which is the correct, loud failure.
- Unenforced free-tier duration/HD limits: `docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/2026-09-29-unenforced-subscription-limits.md`. AGENTS.md's "Enforcement points" list is wrong on this until commit 19.
---

### 2026-09-30 — backend hardening: rights flags, telemetry batch loss, throttle identity
**Learned:**
- **The rights gate read two columns the upload path could not set.** `is_license_restricted` (`entitlements.py:67`) is `bool(is_noncommercial or requires_share_alike)`, but `AudioUploadSerializer.Meta.fields` never listed either — they held the model default `False` forever, while `license_type` was writable, `ChoiceField`-validated, and read by nothing except a `logger.warning`. An NC recording declared correctly was served across all six surfaces. Fixed by deriving the booleans from the validated `license_type` in `create()`; the table is **transcribed** from `ai_ml/scrapers/base.py::license_features` rather than imported, because `ai_ml/scrapers/` is optional (`SCRAPER_ENABLED=False`) and has been deleted twice — an import there would turn a missing package into an `ImportError` on every request. A parity test re-derives both and fails on divergence.
- **`bulk_create` without `ignore_conflicts` against a real `UNIQUE(user, clip, interaction_type)`** discarded up to 500 unrelated users' telemetry per 10s tick: one duplicate rolled back ~5 internal INSERTs inside one transaction, the `except` routed the whole read window to a DLQ that had **zero readers**, and the entries were `XACK`ed. One account, two requests — and `frontend/src/stores/player.tsx` fires a `view` every ~6s, so it fires *organically* (~50 duplicates per 300s clip). `ignore_conflicts` alone would have stopped the loss and left the data silently wrong (first heartbeat survives), so coalescing keeps the **last** event per triple and the flag is only belt-and-braces. Separately: the consumer client had no `decode_responses=True`, so `XREADGROUP` returned `bytes`, `fields.get('payload')` was `None`, and **production was losing 100% of telemetry** into the DLQ branch.
- **Rate limiting was bypassable by rotating one header, and no amount of key-space hygiene fixes it.** `NUM_PROXIES` unset → DRF returns `''.join(xff.split())`, the *entire* client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For`, as the throttle identity; nginx appends, so a client prefix survives. A parallel audit blamed `allkeys-lru` evicting 24h dedup keys and proposed shortening the TTL — **that is a placebo**: the dedup key is written by the Celery consumer behind a 60/min throttle, and LRU evicts *coldest* first, which protects hot throttle keys. The bypass is at the identity layer, so no TTL or key-move touches it. Fixed with `TrustedProxyRateThrottle` delegating to the existing `client_ip.get_client_ip` (which the audit paths already used), plus `NUM_PROXIES: 1` as backstop.
- **Never gate a security guard on `DJANGO_DEBUG`.** The placeholder-secret guard accepted any secret under `DEBUG=True`, and `docker-compose.local.yml` pinned `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` as a *literal* — unoverridable from any env file, and `conftest.py`'s `os.environ.setdefault` cannot override an exported value. So the suite's ability to run depended on a compose literal, and flipping it would have 301'd every test (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` + Django's test client on `http://testserver/` with no `X-Forwarded-Proto`). Fixed with an explicit `ECHOFLOW_TESTING` gate — but note **`conftest.py` sets it too late**: pytest-django calls `django.setup()` during initial-conftest loading, *before* the rootdir conftest body runs. `secrets.testing_enabled()` therefore also recognises `"pytest" in sys.modules`, which is imported strictly earlier.
- **`conftest.py`'s `clear_throttle_cache` does `cache.clear()` = `FLUSHDB` on the live dev Redis.** Every test file that requests it can wipe the shared dev cache mid-suite. Combined with `counter_store.drain()` being `KEYS clip:*` + `DEL`, whole-file results are untrustworthy when agents run concurrently — three runs of *identical* code produced three different failure sets. Give each concurrent agent its own `TEST_DB_NAME` (`conftest.py:59` is env-driven) and prefer an in-memory Redis in new tests.
- **A cleanup block can silently defeat every later test.** `original = RefreshTokenRateThrottle.cache` … `finally: RefreshTokenRateThrottle.cache = original` — `cache` is *inherited*, so the restore installs a **new class attribute on the subclass**, permanently shadowing the parent. Fixtures patch `SimpleRateThrottle.cache`, which then no longer applies, and the throttle reads/writes the live dev Redis. Symptom: a test that passed alone and failed in-file with "0 of 4 allowed" because a real budget was already spent. Use `monkeypatch.setattr`, and a guard test asserting no throttle defines its own `cache`.
- **A test asserting a syntactic shape will break on a correct change.** `TestProductionSslSettings` parsed settings.py's AST for a literal `if not DEBUG:` node, so adding `and not _ECHOfLOW_TESTING` errored 6 tests. The fix broadened the matcher to "gated on `not DEBUG`" *and* strengthened it: any extra conditions must be named like a test switch, so prod hardening can never be gated behind something a deployment could set.
- **Three reports about this work were wrong, and checking cost less than acting on them.** "2 failing tests in `TestRecordSkip`" was stale (resolved by `20f6e7e`); "`SENTRY_DSN` absent from `.env.vps.example`" was false (present-and-empty at `:104`); "telemetry poisons the ranker" was backwards — `add_completion` is called unconditionally by `record_skip` and only on the tier-3 fallback by `record_telemetry`, so `register_skip` is the live path to the 30% term. Also: the feed refill threshold is **not** "`<15`" — there is no view-side threshold at all (`feed.py:77` refills only when empty) and the real one is `>=20` in `feed_tasks.py:96`.
- **A scope-creep test file can be right about the problem and wrong to land.** An agent wrote 884 lines for a `GET /clips/{id}/resolve/` endpoint that did not exist, to make `${origin}/?clip=<id>` deep links work — sound reasoning, but a new public API is an architecture change needing approval. Quarantined while the rest landed; the other agent then implemented it as `resolve_clip` gated on `resolve_clip_access`. Three of its tests were wrong, not the endpoint: the url_name is `clips-resolve-clip` (DefaultRouter prefixes the basename), `_normalise` was handed a literal that never appears in the body, and the permission check used a bare view where per-action `initkwargs` are not applied — plus `isinstance` on permission **classes**, which is always False.

**Changed:** `a10fe14` (rights-flag derivation + `resolve_clip`, 32 files), `f399073` (test-stack DEBUG literal + xfail promoted to assertion). Earlier in the same run: `c12f16b`, `a71a8c8`. Tests added: `test_upload_license_derivation`, `test_cover_image_url`, `test_telemetry_flush_integrity`, `test_throttle_identity_and_secrets`, `test_feed_and_comments_gates`, `test_ranking_exploit_cap`, `test_env_file_hygiene`, `test_clip_resolve`.

**Open:**
- `views/social.py:61` has the same missing-`is_active=True` defect that was fixed in `feed.py` at three sites, and `views/social.py` was owned by nobody. Unfixed.
- The 30% ranking term is **mitigated, not fixed.** A per-`(user, clip)` cap of 3 samples/24h replaces 24,000/day, but the blend prior is still the constant `_COMPLETION_PRIOR_WEIGHT = 10` rather than a running count, so 3 samples/day still converges past 0.9 in ~9 days. The real fix is a persisted `AudioClip.completion_sample_count` + true-prior blend; needs a migration, **owner deferred it**.
- The throttle/IP-fallback and `NUM_PROXIES` work does not cover the two `ScopedRateThrottle` views wired in `urls.py:27` and `:47` (bare `ScopedRateThrottle`, not `TrustedProxyRateThrottle`); `NUM_PROXIES: 1` is the only thing protecting them.
- `docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml` scrapes `http://web:8005/metrics/` with no `X-Forwarded-Proto`; under `DEBUG=False` that 301s and the scrape dies. Already true in prod compose, now also local.
- `celery_beat_local`, `celery_feed_local`, `celery_media_local` still run a **baked image with no `/app` mount** that predates `resolve_redis_url` (`grep -c 'def resolve_redis_url'` = 0 in all three, 1 on the host). `celery_beat_local` holds ESTABLISHED sockets to `172.28.0.2:6379` — a foreign broker that accepts the *local* password — while the local broker is `172.29.0.11`. **Still unidentified.** Rebuild + `--force-recreate` those three before trusting any result from this stack.
- `.env.local` (gitignored) still carries the weak `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin-password` and a placeholder `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` as the live secret. Fix by hand; both were corrected in the `*.example` templates.

### 2026-09-30 — Phase A: test-run Redis isolation
**Learned:**
- **`cache.clear()` was `FLUSHDB` of the live dev cache.** `clear_throttle_cache` needs a global clear (throttle keys are `throttle_*` with no shared prefix), so the fix had to be a *keyspace* change, not a narrower clear. `clear_throttle_cache`'s fail-loud retry behaviour is unchanged.
- **The ordering trap is real and was demonstrated, not assumed.** pytest-django calls `django.setup()` from its own `pytest_load_initial_conftests`; `_pytest.config`'s impl of that hook is `trylast`, so the rootdir `conftest.py` body has not run. Measured: `os.environ['REDIS_CACHE_URL']=.../13` set in the conftest body left `settings.CACHES['default']['LOCATION']` at `.../0`. A `conftest.py` fix would have looked correct and done nothing.
- **`allkeys-lru` is server-wide, so index isolation does not bound memory.** `redis_cache_local` is `maxmemory 1073741824` + `allkeys-lru`; a suite index cannot evict *or* be evicted independently of db0. Measured headroom is huge (1.87 MB used of 1 GB), so this is not a live risk, but it is not an isolation guarantee either.

**Changed:** `backend/EchoFlow/settings.py` (`resolve_test_redis_cache_url` + `TEST_REDIS_CACHE_DB_DEFAULT=13`, gated on `testing_enabled()`), `backend/app/tests/test_env_file_hygiene.py` (two `_NOT_IN_ANY_TEMPLATE` entries). New: `backend/app/tests/test_redis_isolation.py` (16). No migration, no dependency, no conftest edit. Suite **1308 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped, 1 xfailed** (measured with concurrent Phase-B work in the tree, so the count includes tests this change did not add; `test_redis_isolation.py` contributes 16).

**Test-only env vars — deliberately in NO `.env` template** (a template entry would pin the *dev* stack to the suite's index, which is the defect):
- `TEST_REDIS_CACHE_DB=14` — pick the index per run, so parallel agents get separate keyspaces. 1-15; **0 is refused** (that is the live index).
- `TEST_REDIS_CACHE_URL=redis://…/3` — full-URL form, for a CI runner with its own Redis. Wins over the index.

```bash
docker compose exec -e PYTHONPATH=/app -e TEST_DB_NAME=echoflow_test_<unique> \
  -e TEST_REDIS_CACHE_DB=14 web_local pytest backend/app/tests/ -q
```
`TEST_DB_NAME` alone is no longer sufficient for parallel agents — pick `TEST_REDIS_CACHE_DB` too, or the runs share throttle budgets.

**Open:**
- `test_telemetry_flush_integrity.py`'s `redis_scratch` fixture picks `14 + (os.getpid() % 2)` and **FLUSHes it**, so two concurrent runs of that file collide with each other. Measured: 3 failures in one concurrent agent, 1 in the other, while the rest of the suite was green. Pre-existing and independent of this change (it bypasses `CACHES` entirely); the fix is to widen or derive that scratch range per run.
- The **broker** Redis is deliberately *not* retargeted. Every publish path a test can reach is stubbed (`services.uploads.publish`, `tasks.sync_revenuecat_entitlements`), `tasks.py`'s own `.delay()` only runs in a worker, and the one real Redis consumer (`flush_telemetry_stream`) builds its client from `CACHES['default']['LOCATION']`, so it is already isolated. Moving it would strand test-published tasks in a DB no worker reads and desync `celery inspect ping` (the compose healthcheck) from `views/system_health.py`.
- `counter_store.drain()` (`KEYS clip:*` + DEL) still deletes **live** `clip:*` counters every 300 s via the `flush_counters_to_pg` beat task. That is production behaviour and arguably correct (the counters have been folded into Postgres), but it means "live counter keys survive" is not a property anyone can rely on.

### 2026-10-01 — mobile dev-client reconnect: code path vs data path
**Learned:**
- **The Expo dev client is not a one-shot consumer of Metro.** Every foreground return calls `BridgelessDevSupportManager.handleReloadJS()` and re-fetches the bundle, so a lost JS context is unrecoverable until Metro answers again — and the app cannot render its own error because rendering the error *is* the missing bundle. Symptom is the bare `DevLauncher` launcher, which reads as "can't detect the deployment server". Measured: `reactInstance is null` → `onWindowFocusChange(hasFocus=true)` → `Unable to load script`, present since 04:34 across four app PIDs.
- **Code path and data path used different networks, which is why it looked half-alive.** API/HLS are the host LAN IP (`172.25.186.111`) and logged 282+118 requests from the phone (`172.25.186.229`) while Metro logged **zero** bundles — Metro was bound to loopback and a LAN dial to `:8081` was refused. Fix is `--host lan` + the LAN deep link, so the bundle never needs the tunnel.
- **`adb reverse` rules are scoped to the ADB transport, not the device.** All three vanished while `adb devices` still said `device` and the adb server had been up for hours — a USB re-enumeration, logged by neither end.
- **A bound port is not a healthy service.** A killed `workerd` sat `LISTEN`ing, completed the TCP handshake, and timed out `/healthz` after 6s with 0 bytes. Conflating the two states is what made my first supervisor worse than none: it reported green on broken audio, and when it did act it duplicated the service into `Address already in use` once per tick.
- **Killing the top ancestor does not free the port.** `SIGKILL` on `npm exec wrangler` left `node`/`workerd` children re-parented to init, one still holding 8787, so every replacement lost the bind. `wrangler` respawns its own child; signal the **process group** and sweep descendants, then escalate to `SIGKILL`.
- **`PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL` must stay `https://127.0.0.1:19443`.** It is not a "use LAN everywhere" setting: the web page (`https://127.0.0.1:5173`) and media must share a host for the `SameSite=Lax` `ef_hls_token` cookie. Moving it to the LAN address re-breaks web playback. Native clients are unaffected because they send `X-EchoFlow-Media-Token`.

**Changed:** `scripts/mobile-dev-supervisor.sh` (new — supervises Metro + Worker + the three forwards, distinguishes bound/healthy/hung, process-group kill, per-service start cooldown, `--status`/`--once`), `docs/mobile/05-device-control-and-troubleshooting.md`.

**Verified:** backgrounded the app 35s and returned to it — 0 load failures, Metro served the bundle over LAN, then live `GET /feed/` `200`s and playback to `0:53 / 2:29`. Killed Metro + Worker + all forwards at once; all three recovered within one 30s tick.

**Open:**
- **The supervisor is not supervised.** It dies with the shell unless launched `setsid nohup` — the exact failure class it fixes. A `systemd --user` unit is the obvious next step, not written.
- Every start redirects to `/tmp/metro.log` and `/tmp/hls-worker.log` with `>`, so a restart **truncates** the previous log. Use `>>` if post-mortem continuity matters.
- **Web playback is still unverified by me** (no browser here). `https://127.0.0.1:5173` serves correctly; the user has not confirmed audio.
- `.env.local` / `frontend/.env` are gitignored, so the origins do not travel: a fresh clone needs `PUBLIC_HLS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, and the loopback CORS origins set by hand.

### 2026-10-01 — frontend deploy: lockfile, and a test race that was really a Node-major race
**Learned:**
- **Cloudflare Pages picks the package manager from the lockfile in the repo**, so a committed `bun.lock` forced `bun install --frozen-lockfile` against Pages' pinned Bun 1.2.15 while `bun.lock` was `lockfileVersion: 2` (needs Bun ≥ 1.3) — the deploy died at install, before the build command. That lockfile was also an AI Studio scaffold that had drifted from `package.json` (locked `@google/genai`/`dotenv`/`express`/`multer`/`motion`, locked nothing for `vitest`/`jsdom`/`@testing-library/*`). Meanwhile `.gitignore` excluded `frontend/package-lock.json`, so `deploy-frontend.yml`'s `npm ci` could not have worked either. **A lockfile policy and the deploy workflow silently contradicted each other and only the Pages failure was visible.**
- **`waitFor` runs its callback synchronously on the first check** (`node_modules/@testing-library/dom/dist/wait-for.js`: `checkCallback()` is called inside the Promise executor, after `setInterval`/`MutationObserver`, with no `await` before it) and then resolves. So `await waitFor(() => expect(node).toBeInTheDocument())` is **already true while the node is a `<Skeleton>`**, and the assertion on the next line reads the pre-fetch DOM. Measured on `ProfilePage`: `h1` was still empty after 6 microtask hops, `waitFor`'s first check saw `""`, and the DOM was populated only by the time the `await` resumed — a margin of a few microtasks.
- **"Passes locally, fails in CI" was a Node *major* difference, not slowness.** No `engines`, no `.nvmrc`; local ran v24.19.0 while Pages and all three workflows pinned 20. Proven in Docker on one host, so speed was controlled: unpatched `profile.test.tsx` → **2 failed under `node:20`, 22 passed under `node:24`**, and the two failures were byte-for-byte the CI ones. Patched: 443/443 under `node:20`. **Do not explain a green local suite as a slow CI machine without testing the runtime — `docker run node:<ci-major>` is the instrument.**
- **Latency probes must not use real timers.** Injecting `setTimeout` into `fetchMock` breaks the 7 of 22 files that call `vi.useFakeTimers()`, so its failure count measures nothing. Running the suite under the CI's Node major is both cleaner and exact.

**Changed:** `frontend/src/test/profile.test.tsx` (3 tests now wait on the value that proves the fetch landed, not on a node the skeleton owns), `951e431`; `e215330` removed `frontend/bun.lock` and committed `frontend/package-lock.json`; `mobile/README.md` lockfile note.

**Verified:** `node:20` (Pages' runtime) → 443/443 in Docker. Unpatched → the 2 CI failures reproduced deterministically.

**Open:**
- **The Node version is pinned in three places that disagree, and one is not in the repo.** Pages is set in the dashboard (`NODE_VERSION`), workflows hardcode `node-version: '20'`, and a developer's local Node is whatever they happen to have. Changing the Pages dashboard alone does not change the workflows, and a build that reports `nodejs@20.20.2` ignored the intended change.
- `951e431` is on `feat/frontend-mvp` and **was not pushed** when Pages built, so the same failure recurred verbatim (the error's line numbers were the pre-patch ones — read them to tell "same bug" from "new bug").
- No guard against the class: any future test that waits on a skeleton-owned node can pass on one Node major and fail on another. A two-version CI matrix would catch it; not added.

### Working agreement (owner correction, 2026-09-29)

I make mistakes at a rate that this repo does not tolerate. In the first three
commits of the frontend rebuild I: asserted a validation gap that the framework
already covered (B1), wrote a query-count assertion that measured two
pre-existing N+1s instead of my own field (B2), and reported a passing suite
while a Redis container was crash-looping underneath it. All three were caught
late and cost a debugging cycle each.

Going forward:

- **Verify the premise before implementing it.** When a plan asserts that
  something is missing, read the model, the framework layer, or the
  neighbouring code first. If reality differs, stop and say so rather than
  building on the plan's description.
- **Ask for a decision instead of guessing** whenever scope expands beyond the
  approved plan, a fix is larger than planned, or two readings are plausible.
  A question costs a reply; a wrong 3-commit sequence costs a revert and a
  re-audit. Default to asking when the cost of being wrong exceeds the cost of
  asking.
- **Never report a result without confirming the harness was healthy.** Check
  container status, and confirm a suspicious failure set is unchanged against a
  stashed baseline before calling anything green.
- **State uncertainty in the report, not just the conclusion.** "614 passed"
  without "and by the way a cache container was down" is a misleading report
  even when the number happens to be right.

Being asked to double-check is not second-guessing; it is the correct
response to a measured error rate.
