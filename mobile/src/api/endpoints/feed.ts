 * 10 ids off the user's queue. Re-requesting a page you already got does not
 * return it again; it returns the NEXT ten (or a 202 once the queue drains).
 *
 * Consequence for callers: never treat this as a refetchable query. Do not put
 * it behind a "retry on error" that re-issues the same call, do not let
 * TanStack Query refetch it (it will, on window focus and on mount), and do
 * not call it twice for one screenful. `useFeedBuffer` accumulates and dedupes
 * so the buffer grows monotonically instead.
 *
 * 200 → `{results, next:'auto_trigger', queue_health, degraded?}`
 * 202 → `{results: [], message, retry_after_ms, degraded: true}` (cold queue)
 *
 * Note the 202 body DOES carry `results: []` — see the `parseFeedResponse`
 * docstring for why the discriminator has to be `retry_after_ms` and not the
 * absence of results.

 * near-miss ("Lo-Fi" vs "Lo-Fi Beats") is a silently EMPTY result set rather
 * than an error. Use the values from `src/design/categories.ts` verbatim.
 *
 * `all` is the one exception and is now honoured as "unfiltered" server-side
 * (`SuggestionViewSet.get_queryset`). It used to be matched literally against
 * a free-text column, so it matched nothing — which is why this caller
 * previously hardcoded `music` as a workaround and a cold start could only
 * ever show one category.
 *
 * The backend's docstring for this viewset still says `/suggestions/explore/`;
 * that route does not exist. The registered route is the flat
 * `/suggestions/` (urls.py), which is what this calls.
 *
 * Results are **validated**, not cast. The old signature returned
 * `clips: unknown[]` and the caller did `rows as FeedClip[]`, so a drifted
 * serializer surfaced as an undefined-property crash inside `ReelCard` — and
 * a row with no `id` became an `undefined` `keyExtractor`, which corrupts
 * VirtualizedList cell reuse rather than failing loudly.
