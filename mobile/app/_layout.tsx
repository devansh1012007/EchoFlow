/**
 * Root layout. Providers only — no navigation decisions, no data fetching.
 *
 * Auth routing is decided in `app/index.tsx` (a redirect), not by conditionally
 * rendering stacks here. Two reasons: a conditional stack means every screen
 * unmounts on a status flip (losing player position, in Phase 2), and it makes
 * the back stack ambiguous after a re-login. Route groups plus `<Redirect>`
 * give a deterministic stack.
 *
 * Fonts are gated: the app renders nothing until Lexend loads. The design
 * system's identity is the type (globals.css:77-78, "weight + tracking do the
 * work"), and a first paint in the system font reflows every screen when the
 * real font arrives — a visible flash on every cold start.

   *  2. `applyPlaybackAudioMode` reconfigures the platform audio session. On

                independent so an auth-status flip cannot unmount either.
