# With PgBouncer's DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE=25 in front of web/celery, 25
# slow queries would exhaust the pool and the app would stop
# accepting new connections. Each timeout trades a worse error
# (QueryCanceled / lock timeout / fatal "terminating connection due

#
# DECISION: apply these GUCs via the psycopg2 `options='-c ...'`
# connection string. Two requirements to make this work behind
# pgbouncer transaction mode:
#   1. pgbouncer's `ignore_startup_parameters` (set in
#      docker-compose.yml as IGNORE_STARTUP_PARAMETERS=...) must
#      include each of these GUC names. Without that whitelist,
#      pgbouncer rejects the connection at startup with
#        FATAL: unsupported startup parameter in options: statement_timeout
#      and every web/celery container crashes before its first query.
#      pgbouncer does NOT apply these settings itself — it only
#      ignores the unknown name so the client request can pass
#      through to Postgres, which honors the `-c` prefix.
#   2. `connect_timeout` is a libpq *connection* parameter (passed
#      to PQconnectdb), NOT a GUC. It MUST be a top-level psycopg2
#      kwarg. Putting it inside the `-c ...` string raises
#        `unrecognized configuration parameter "connect_timeout"`
#      because the server tries to SET it like a GUC and fails.
#
# The `options`/`connect_timeout` kwargs are psycopg2-specific;
# SQLite (used in tests) does not accept them. Skip when the engine
# is not Postgres. `dj_database_url` may return an empty dict when
# DATABASE_URL is unset; check the engine key to be safe.

# `DATABASE_URL` *from* `DB_PASSWORD`::
#
#     DATABASE_URL=postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
#
# so the value the process actually authenticates with is
# `DATABASES['default']['PASSWORD']`. Checking the env var NAME was checking
# the wrong thing: the name is genuinely absent from this module, and the
# secret is not. It is checked here rather than at the top of the file
# because this is the first point at which the value exists.
#

# this repository in plain text, so a deployment that copies a template
# unchanged hands anyone who has read the repo the whole database: every user
# row, every password hash, and the DPDP §8(5) erasure records.
#
# An EMPTY password is not a placeholder failure and is deliberately not
# treated as one. There is no `if not SECRET_KEY` raise above for the same
# reason: bare-metal development against a local Postgres that trusts the
# socket, or a `DATABASE_URL` with no credential at all, is a legitimate
# configuration. What is rejected is a value that looks like documentation.

    DECISION (2026-09-29): ``{prefix}_HOST`` wins over ``{prefix}_URL``.

    This inverts what the code did before, and the reason is that the old
    order was actively wrong. Every compose service sets::

        REDIS_BROKER_HOST: redis_broker_local
        REDIS_BROKER_PORT: 6379

    deliberately, because Redis passwords here contain base64 characters

        REDIS_BROKER_URL = os.getenv("REDIS_BROKER_URL", build_redis_url("REDIS_BROKER"))

    so a *stale* ``REDIS_BROKER_URL`` left in ``.env.local`` silently
    overrode the host compose had just specified, defeating the split.

    Consequence found the hard way: the local stack was publishing to a

    publishes gave 2 SUCCESS and 4 NotRegistered — the foreign worker wins
    the coin flip and rejects task names it does not know. That presents as
    "my new Celery task never runs", which is a very misleading symptom for
    a stale env var.

# `DEL`) is a second door into that same shared keyspace, so two concurrent
# runs delete each other's state even without a flush. Postgres is already
# isolated per run by TEST_DB_NAME, which is what made this read as flakiness
# rather than as a gap: three runs of identical, unmodified code produced three
# different failure sets.
#
# WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN conftest.py: pytest-django calls
# `django.setup()` from its own `pytest_load_initial_conftests`, while
# `_pytest.config`'s implementation of that same hook is `trylast`, so the
# rootdir conftest's module body has not run yet. An `os.environ[...]` assigned
# there cannot reach CACHES — this module is imported *inside*
# `django.setup()`. `backend/app/tests/test_redis_isolation.py` pins both
# halves of that claim (the env var does work; a late one provably does not).
#
# The gate is `testing_enabled()`, the signal `secrets.py` already uses: true

# received the upload. That's only true in this specific docker-compose
# setup, and only true today because of a dev-convenience bind mount — it is
# NOT true of a real deployment (separate machines/nodes for web vs workers,
# autoscaled worker pools, no shared disk). Rather than keep patching volume
# paths to make the shared-filesystem assumption hold a little longer, we're
# removing the assumption: media now lives in S3-compatible object storage
# that every container reaches over the network, identically, in every
# environment. No shared volume, no bind-mount coincidence, no "works on my

# SECURITY: Production-only cookie + transport hardening.

#
# ECHOFLOW_TESTING is a THIRD, independent reason to skip this block, and it
# exists because relying on `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` here stopped being reliable.
# `docker-compose.local.yml` used to hardcode `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` as a
# literal, and `conftest.py` sets it with `os.environ.setdefault` — which is a
# no-op the moment the container already exports a value. So the suite's
# ability to run depended on an unoverridable literal in a compose file. That
# literal is now `${DJANGO_DEBUG:-False}`, and once the container is recreated
# the suite would come up with DEBUG=False and `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`,
# 301-ing every request Django's test client makes to `http://testserver/`
# (the client sends no `X-Forwarded-Proto`).
#
# Gating on an explicit flag rather than on DEBUG also stops the suite from
# lying about the environment: DEBUG now reflects the real container value, so
# the settings in this block are exercised where they are meant to be.
#
# The test detection is `EchoFlow.secrets.testing_enabled`, not a bare env-var
# read here, for a timing reason that is easy to get wrong: pytest-django calls
# django.setup() while loading initial conftests, which is BEFORE the rootdir
# conftest.py module body runs. So an env var that conftest.py sets is not yet
# in os.environ at the moment this line executes. `testing_enabled()` also
# recognises pytest itself, which is imported strictly earlier.
