# construction in the request thread *before* Postgres is reached, plus 2.1 s
# of query. Note the Python half is NOT bounded by statement_timeout=30s
# (settings.py:225) — only the SQL half is.
# 20 is ~1.6x what the product actually sends: `available_tags` caps its
# offer at _MAX_OFFERED_TAGS (12) and the picker can select at most that
# many, leaving headroom while keeping the worst case trivial. This bound

# tracks (backend/app/tasks.py:364 — the old citation said 296, which is
# wrong). A single KeyBERT unigram is far below 64 chars, so 64 is already

    This is `initialize_vectors`' own three non-tag conditions, verbatim, MINUS

    advertises a tag only when that tag matches at least one clip *in exactly
    the population the matcher will query*, so the offer cannot drift from the
    match. If you add `status='ready'` or an NC/SA exclusion here and not in
    the matcher, the two disagree again and the invariant this endpoint exists
    to guarantee is gone.

    WHY DUPLICATED RATHER THAN SHARED. The obvious refactor is one helper both
    actions call. It was not done because `initialize_vectors` is contract-pinned
    by `test_tags_initialize_bounds.py` (it asserts on the exact SQL that
    reaches Postgres — the number of `@>` clauses for a given input), so
    touching its body is a larger blast radius than this endpoint warrants.
    The duplication is three clauses and is flagged here and in the test file;
    it is the smaller risk of the two, and the invariant test fails loudly the
    moment the two copies diverge.

    NOT IN THIS POPULATION, DELIBERATELY: `status='ready'` and the NC/SA
    exclusion. `initialize_vectors` filters on neither, so a tag whose only
    eligible clips are NC or not-yet-ready WOULD be offered here and WOULD build
    a baseline. That looseness is the matcher's, it predates this endpoint, and
    it is tracked separately (it is also why `A3`'s rights gate does not cover
    this action). Tightening it in one of the two places — rather than both —
    is precisely the drift this helper's docstring is warning about.

        name (`ViewSetMixin.initialize_request`) and `url_path` is only where
        the handler is mounted. Keying on `url_path` is what silently killed
        all five A4 clip scopes and then all seven ContentViewSet scopes in this
        codebase — twice, in this same file family — and a wrong key does not
        raise, it just leaves the endpoint unthrottled.

        The fallback is the WRITE scope, not the read one. An action added here
        without a mapping is, by default, something that writes and publishes;
        if it turns out to be a read, a too-tight rate is a visible 429 and one
        line of fix, whereas the reverse is invisible.

        The inherited throttle classes are kept (no `get_throttles` override,
        unlike `AudioUploadViewSet.SCOPED_ONLY_ACTIONS`) so the 1000/hour
        `user` bucket stays as a backstop beneath the scope. Note the two
        failure directions are different, and neither is graceful: if this
        property ever returned None the action would be accounted only by that
        generic bucket, whereas a scope *name* with no entry in
        `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` raises `ImproperlyConfigured` and 500s on
        every request. So the mapping above and the two rate keys in settings
        have to move together; `test_tags_available_endpoint.py` asserts both.

        """The tags this catalogue actually has, with the clip count of each.

        WHY THIS EXISTS. The onboarding modal used to offer eight hardcoded ids
        (comedy, science, motivation, music, quotes, instrumental, tech,
        mindset) and preselect two. Those are `AudioClip.category` values being
        passed as `tags`; `initialize_vectors` matches with exact JSONB
        containment, `tags @> '["comedy"]'::jsonb`, which no clip in the corpus
        satisfies. So not one of the eight could ever match, every cold start
        returned 400 "Not enough data to build baseline.", and
        `select count(*) from app_user where long_term_semantic is not null`
        was 0 — the feature had never once succeeded. This endpoint is what
        makes it possible to succeed: the client renders whatever is really
        there instead of a list of guesses.

        WHAT THE VOCABULARY IS — read this before "improving" the endpoint.
        `AudioClip.tags` is written by `process_audio_to_hls` from the Whisper
        transcript using KeyBERT **unigrams** — `tags = [kw[0] for kw in
        keywords]`, `keyphrase_ngram_range=(1, 1)`, `top_n=3`
        (backend/app/tasks.py:360) — plus the literal "instrumental" for
        instrumental-only tracks (tasks.py:364). A tag is therefore a *word
        lifted out of a lyric*, not a curated genre label: on this repo's local
        catalogue (13 clips, 12 of them eligible) there are 34 distinct tags, of
        which exactly two ("feel", "listen") appear on more than one clip. It is
        expected — not a bug to be smoothed over — that this list is short and
        slightly odd.

        SO: do not hardcode moods here, and do not union this with a curated
        list. The instant the response stops being derived from the corpus, the
        vocabulary drifts from the data again and we are back to offering tags
        that return 400. If the catalogue's tagging needs improving, improve
        `tasks.py`; this endpoint is only the honest view of whatever it
        produces.

        Empty catalogue is a VALID answer, not an error: the response is
        `{"tags": []}` with a 200, and the client renders an honest "not enough
        audio to personalise yet" state from it. It is deliberately not a 404
        (nothing is missing), not a 400 (the request was fine) and not a single
        consolation tag (offering one clip's tag is what `_MIN_CLIPS_PER_
        OFFERED_TAG` exists to prevent).
