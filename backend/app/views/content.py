        Before A4 every action inherited ``upload`` (20/hour), which is the
        right number for pushing 100 MB files and the wrong number for
        everything else. A shared link's landing page returning 429 after 20
        views is a broken share feature, and it fails in exactly the way that
        is hardest to notice: the link works for you, then stops working.

        FIX (2026-09-29): the keys below were the actions' **url_path**
        values, but DRF sets ``self.action`` to the **method name**
        (``ViewSetMixin.initialize_request`` assigns ``self.action`` from the
        handler it routed to; ``url_path`` only decides where the handler is
        mounted). So none of these ever matched, and all five A4 scopes were
        dead code — every action fell through to ``upload``. The symptom was a
        read-only ``GET /clips/{id}/`` being charged the 20/hour upload budget,
        which 429s a client polling clip status during an HLS encode.

        Keys are therefore method names, matching what DRF actually sets.
        See docs/EXPLAIN/decisions/2026-09-29-clip-throttle-scopes.md.

        Same 409 shape and the same "value, not key presence" comparison as
        ``_refuse_post_approval_rights_change`` below; what differs is the
        SCOPE, and that difference is the point of a separate method rather
        than a widened one.

        Why the post-approval guard is not enough any more
        ---------------------------------------------------
        It only runs when ``clip.moderation_approved`` is true, and its premise
        — "nothing has been moderated, so there is no approved rights record to
        contradict" — was written when ``license_type`` was advisory. That is no
        longer true. ``AudioUploadSerializer.create`` now DERIVES
        ``is_noncommercial`` / ``requires_share_alike`` from the validated
        ``license_type`` and freezes them there, because
        ``services.entitlements.is_license_restricted`` is a two-boolean
        predicate and those two columns are the only rights gate in the
        platform. So ``license_type`` is load-bearing from the moment the row
        exists, and the window between upload and approval is now exactly
        where the divergence opens:

            POST /clips/  license_type="CC-BY-NC"   -> (True, False)
            PATCH /clips/{id}/  license_type="Owned" -> row now SAYS Owned
            POST /clips/{id}/approve-moderation/     -> (True, False) held
                -> served as commercial, from a record that declares it owned

        That is worse than the pre-fix state, not better: previously the
        declared licence and the enforced flags were *consistently* empty; now
        they can actively contradict each other in a moderation-approved row,
        and the declared value is what any downstream rights check, operator
        screen or legal disclosure would read. Freezing the label closes it.

        409, not a silent strip
        ----------------------
        The N8 ``original_file`` treatment drops the field and returns 200. That
        is the wrong register here: a client rendering a licence dropdown would
        display the value it just sent and have no way to know the server threw
        it away, so the UI would assert a licence the database does not hold.
        The remedy is in the response body — delete and re-upload — the same
        remedy ``original_file`` already has, and the one the field-level error
        can actually name.

        Atomic, and deliberately so
        --------------------------
        A title edit sent in the same request is refused too. A partial apply
        leaves the client unable to tell which half landed, and the half that
        landed is the dangerous one — same rule, same reason, same shape as
        ``_refuse_post_approval_rights_change``.

        Not frozen, on purpose
        ---------------------
        ``copyright_owner_name`` stays editable pre-approval. It is attribution
        metadata rather than a gate input — nothing reads it — so freezing it
        would block the ordinary "I mistyped the credit" fix on a clip that is
        not published yet, for no enforcement gain. It is still frozen
        post-approval, by the guard below.

        (A3) SCOPE OF THIS GUARD, stated plainly: it makes the *declaration*
        immutable. It does not and cannot make a false declaration detectable.
        A user who uploads NonCommercial audio while declaring ``"Owned"`` is
        unaffected by this and by the derivation alike — there is no audio
        classifier on the upload path, and the one classifier in the repo reads
        a licence string, not audio. See the note above
        ``LICENSE_RESTRICTION_FEATURES`` in ``serializers.py``.

        409 Conflict, same register as the two other state-dependent
        refusals in this file (``share_link`` answers 409 for "clip media is
        not ready", ``play_shared`` deliberately checks the media key before
        the licence so a mid-encode caller gets 409 rather than 403). The
        request is well-formed; it conflicts with the resource's state.

        The policy
        ----------
        ``title`` and ``category`` stay freely editable after approval, and
        ``license_type`` / ``copyright_owner_name`` do not. A moderation
        decision is about the *audio*: ``run_moderation_check``
        (services/content_moderation.py:132-179) checks the audio
        fingerprint, the tags and the transcript, and moderation runs Whisper
        over the file. A mistyped title is a typo, and forcing re-approval
        over one would take a published clip out of every feed and suggestion
        query for a cosmetic change — the edit would appear to revert and the
        clip would vanish, which is a worse failure than the one being
        prevented. So presentation metadata is not gated.

        Why the rights fields are refused rather than re-moderated
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        The obvious alternative is to set ``moderation_approved = False`` on a
        rights-field change. That is worse on both axes:

        1. It buys nothing. Nothing in ``run_moderation_check`` reads the
           licence, the owner or the acknowledgement, so the re-check would
           re-evaluate the audio against checks that cannot detect a rights
           problem. The clip would be withdrawn and re-admitted unchanged.
        2. It costs the user their content. There is no un-approve route
           (content_moderation.py:108 notes this) and nothing re-approves
           automatically, so the clip silently leaves every feed until the
           owner notices and calls approve-moderation again.

        Refusing is inert: a 409 changes no field, so the clip stays exactly
        as servable as it was.

        Premise correction, and a later one
        -----------------------------------
        The finding this answers described ``license_type`` as the thing that
        makes a clip NonCommercial. It does not. ``is_noncommercial`` and
        ``requires_share_alike`` are separate columns, absent from
        ``AudioUploadSerializer.Meta.fields``, derived at upload time — so
        PATCH cannot open the redistribution gate at all
        (pinned by
        ``test_the_rights_flags_are_not_writable_through_the_api``). What
        PATCH *could* do was silently rewrite the declared licence and
        attribution of an upload a moderator already ruled on, with no audit
        event. That is an audit-integrity defect, not a redistribution
        bypass, and the severity claimed for it should be read down to match.

        LATER, AND IT INVALIDATED PART OF THE ABOVE. ``create()`` now derives
        the two flags from the validated ``license_type`` (DEFECT A), so the
        licence became load-bearing for the gate and the "nothing has been
        moderated yet, so there is no reason to refuse" early-return below is
        no longer sound for it. ``license_type`` is therefore frozen at create
        by ``_refuse_licence_relabel``, which runs first and unconditionally.
        By the time this method runs, ``license_type`` can only ever appear in
        ``changed`` as an unchanged echo, so the field that is still doing work
        here is ``copyright_owner_name`` — attribution metadata that was never
        a gate input and is not frozen pre-approval, precisely so a mistyped
        credit can be corrected on a clip that is not published yet.

        Two deliberate exclusions
        ------------------------
        * ``copyright_acknowledgement`` is not frozen. It is a one-way
          affirmation: False -> True strengthens the record and can never
          weaken it, and the stored column is the durable proof of a
          declaration made at upload time. Guarding it would also 409 every
          save on a legacy row uploaded before the acknowledgement became
          mandatory — a failure with no security value.
        * The comparison is by **value**, not key presence. A form that
          submits the whole object sends ``license_type`` back unchanged on
          every save; refusing that would break the shipped clip-edit form for
          nothing. Only a value that actually differs from the stored one is
          a rewrite.

        What the user sees
        ------------------

        self-approves its own clip — that is the current v1 workflow, and
        denying it would leave uploads permanently stuck in `processing` until
        a human looked at them.

        HONEST LIMITATION: with the owner allowed, moderation is not a gate.
        A user can upload, self-approve, and be published after only the
        keyword checks in services/content_moderation.py run. That is the
        accepted v1 state, and this change narrows the abuse surface (from
        anyone to the uploader) without pretending to more. Making it a real

        could not tell what was reported or triage it. IT Rules 2021 R3(1)(b)

        """Resolve ONE clip by id for a deep link, as JSON.

        Why this exists
        ---------------
        The share feature copies ``${origin}/?clip=<id>`` and the backend
        already mints a 30-day, per-clip-scoped share token. Nothing read the
        parameter, so every shared link opened the generic feed.

        The obvious way to resolve the id client-side is ``GET /clips/{id}/``,
        and that **cannot work**. ``get_queryset`` is
        ``filter(creator=self.request.user)`` (:117-120), so ``retrieve``
        answers 404 for every clip the requester did not upload — which is
        every real share. The deep link would have reported "not available on
        your account" for a clip that is perfectly available, on the one
        screen whose entire job is to open what somebody sent you.

        So this is a read that is gated on ``resolve_clip_access`` rather
        than on ownership. That is deliberate: the entitlement rule already
        lives in exactly one place (``services/entitlements.py:70``) and
        re-deriving it here is how "what is servable" ended up with two
        drifting implementations in the first place.

        Deliberate properties:

        * **404 for both "does not exist" and "not yours"**, so this is not
          an existence oracle. Same shape as ``retrieve``, for the same
          reason.
        * **No playback credential is granted.** Authorisation to *play* is
          still ``POST /media/playback-token/{id}/`` (:677), which mints a
          600 s token and does its own access check. This endpoint answers a
          question about metadata only.
        * **``status`` is not gated here.** A clip that is approved but still
          encoding comes back with its real status so the client can say
          "still processing" and let the playback probe's 409 stand as the
          authoritative answer. Filtering it out here would collapse two
          distinct, honest states into one 404.
        * ``clip_read`` scope, same as ``retrieve``/``list`` — a resolve is a
          read, and it deliberately keeps the inherited 1000/hour user bucket
          as a backstop (see ``SCOPED_ONLY_ACTIONS``).

        A4 (2026-09-29). This is the landing surface for a shared link, and it

        * ``Accept: application/json`` (or a fetch/XHR) -> reduced JSON
          metadata, for the app.
        * anything else (a browser, a chat client unfurling the link) -> a
          small HTML page carrying Open Graph tags.

        The HTML branch is the reason this works today. There is no deployed
        web frontend — nginx is ``server_name _`` proxying only to Django, and
        ``frontend/`` holds samples — so a shared link has no page to land on
        and the only thing that renders a bare URL is a link unfurl. OG tags
        are what make the share legible in WhatsApp/Slack/X without building
        a site first.

        SECURITY: the queryset filter keeps unservable clips invisible here.
        Filtering in the queryset rather than raising a 403 deliberately —
        a 404/403 split would confirm whether a given UUID exists to someone
        with no entitlement to ask.

        A4 (2026-09-30, W2-H): the filter used to be
        ``moderation_approved=True`` and nothing else, so this was the one
        clip surface the licence work never reached. An unauthenticated caller
        got a rendered title, description and cover image for NonCommercial
        audio, for ShareAlike audio, and for clips still mid-encode — the
        exact metadata ``feed.py``, ``social.py:173`` and this file's own
        ``share_link`` / ``play_shared`` withhold. The audio stayed
        token-gated, so this was metadata disclosure plus feed inconsistency
        rather than a playback bypass, but a page whose content model
        disagreed with the feed's is exactly the drift that produced the
        original gap.

        The four conditions are copied verbatim from ``profile.py:80-86`` and
        ``feed.py:183-187`` rather than re-derived, for the reason
        ``services/entitlements.py`` exists: two "what is servable" filters
        that disagree are how this hole was created in the first place.

        All four sit in the **queryset** rather than being a filter plus an
        ``is_license_restricted`` check with a 403, which is the shape
        ``social.py:166-181`` uses. That is deliberate and differs on
        purpose: this action is ``AllowAny`` on an unguessable UUID, so
        existence confirmation is the only thing at stake and a 403 would give
        it away for free. Here a non-servable clip 404s *byte-identically* to
        one that was never created, so the page is not an oracle. The
        trade-off is a recipient whose share link has gone stale sees "not
        found" rather than "may not be shared" — and the only way a minted
        share link can point at an NC clip is if the clip was flipped after
        minting, which is the fail-closed direction anyway.

        credential at all.

        Authorization is two checks, and the second is the one that matters:

        1. ``verify_token`` proves the ``?s=`` value is one we signed and has
           not expired.
        2. ``payload["c"]`` must equal this clip's storage key. Without that,
           any valid token would unlock any clip — a recipient could take the
           ``?s=`` from the link they were sent and swap the clip id in the
           path. This is the "is this actually a reel which was shared to the
           user" check.

        The caller is anonymous and gets a short TTL, so the long-lived share
        token never has to be attached to a player.
