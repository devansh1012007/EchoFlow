"""Signal handlers for app models.

N9 fix: when an AudioClip is deleted, remove its files from object
storage. Without this, every user-deletion cascade (creator FK is
on_delete=CASCADE) leaves the original upload and the HLS segment
tree in S3/MinIO forever. Same for explicit DELETE /clips/{id} or
any future admin delete.

S3 prefix to clean on delete:
  uploads/YYYY/MM/DD/<uuid>.<ext>  (the original_file)
  hls/<clip_id>/master.m3u8, seg-N.ts, index.m3u8  (the rendered HLS)

Both are stored in default_storage (S3Storage in production,
FileSystemStorage in dev). The S3 backend supports listdir() and
delete() on keys.
