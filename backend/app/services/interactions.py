"""Interaction service layer.

Stage 3 of the relational-to-event-driven plan: every write to
`UserInteraction` flows through these functions, never directly
through ORM in a view. As of the 2026-09 metrics rewrite, the
F() counter side-effect on AudioClip has been removed; all
counter writes go through Redis (counter_store) and the
flush_counters_to_pg task is the only path from Redis to
Postgres.

Behavior contract (preserved from pre-refactor views/interactions.py):
  * toggle_like: get_or_create + toggle is_active; the UserInteraction
    save() fires a Redis INCRBY via counter_store (no F()).
  * register_skip: writes a completion sample + skip counter to
    Redis. The flusher materializes a UserInteraction row per
    (user, clip) per beat.
  * record_telemetry: emits a JSON event to a Redis Stream (primary)
    with a Redis list as fallback. The stream consumer
    (tasks.flush_telemetry_stream) bulk-inserts UserInteraction rows
    AND invalidates each affected user's cached user_vectors.
    On Redis failure it falls back to a Redis counter-store write
    so the event is not lost.
  * record_share: get_or_create the share interaction. The
    UserInteraction save() fires a Redis INCRBY on shares.

# User-vectors cache invalidation.
# Group B item 10 (N11 cache invalidation wiring).
#
# Background: get_user_vectors() in views/feed.py caches the
# time-decayed user vector for 15 min. The cache was previously only
# refreshed by TTL expiry — every state-changing interaction (like,
# skip) was silently leaving the cache stale for up to 15 min. The
# helper invalidate_user_vectors_cache() existed in views/feed.py
# but had zero callers (per the audit verification).
#
# This module re-exports the helper (kept in views/feed.py for the
# /suggestions/ endpoint to find without a circular import) AND owns
# the canonical key prefix. Services that mutate user state call
# invalidate_user_vectors_cache(user_id) here.
#
# DECISION: the helper lives in BOTH places to avoid a circular
# import. views/feed.py cannot import from this module without
# dragging in `calculate_time_decayed_vectors` (which is in
# tasks.py) and the service-layer machinery. This module CAN import
# the key constant from views/feed.py without cycles. The duplication
# is one constant and one function — minor cost for clean layering.
