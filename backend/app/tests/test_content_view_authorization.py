"""Authorization + state-scoping tests for `views/content.py`.

Three holes, all on the same viewset, all found by reading the file against
the predicates its neighbours already use.

Finding 1 — `GET /clips/{id}/public/` published metadata for unservable clips
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
`public_view` is `AllowAny` and is the **only** place the API origin serves
rendered HTML: a chat client unfurling a shared link gets an Open Graph title,
description and cover image out of it. Its queryset filtered
`moderation_approved=True` and nothing else.

Every other clip surface applies four conditions. `views/feed.py:111+115`
(primary), `:135+137` (degraded fallback), `:183-187` (suggestions),
`views/social.py:166-172` (send-share) and `views/profile.py:80-86` all require

    status='ready' AND moderation_approved=True
    AND is_noncommercial=False AND requires_share_alike=False

`public_view` applied the second of the four. So an unauthenticated caller got
a rendered card for NC audio, for SA audio, and for clips still mid-encode —
the exact metadata `feed.py`, `social.py:173` and `content.py`'s own
`share_link` / `play_shared` withhold. The A4 licence work closed this
everywhere else; this was the last surface.

Note the *audio* was still token-gated, so this is metadata disclosure plus
feed inconsistency, not a playback bypass. The severity is in the
inconsistency: the feed, the share pipeline and the public page then disagreed
about what exists.

Why 404 and not 403
--------------------
`content.py:546-561` already made its 403s deliberately indistinguishable
("A valid share link is required." for both a bad token and a
right-token-wrong-clip), and `:528-532` documents a deliberate 409-before-403
ordering. This file follows that sensibility by putting the whole predicate in
the **queryset**, so a non-servable clip 404s exactly like a nonexistent one —
no 403/404 split to read existence off. See `TestExistenceOracle`.

Finding 2 — post-approval PATCH could rewrite the rights record
--------------------------------------------------------------
`title`, `category` and `license_type` are all writable on a clip that is
already `moderation_approved=True` and `status='ready'`, and the update resets
neither flag nor re-runs moderation.

`license_type` was originally believed to be the harmless one — it did *not*
drive `is_noncommercial` / `requires_share_alike`, which were separate columns
only the scraper wrote, and a PATCH therefore could not open the
redistribution gate at all. What it *could* do was silently rewrite the
declared licence and attribution of content a moderator had already ruled on:
an audit-integrity problem, not a bypass.

**That premise is now void.** `AudioUploadSerializer.create` derives both
flags from the validated `license_type` and freezes them there
(`serializers.py:538-543`), because `services.entitlements.is_license_restricted`
is a two-boolean predicate and those two columns are the only rights gate in
the platform. So the declaration is load-bearing from the moment the row
exists, and "freeze the rights record after approval" is no longer sufficient:
the window between upload and approval is exactly where a relabel would make
the declared licence contradict the frozen flags.

The label is therefore refused on **every** clip now, approved or not
(`CREATE_TIME_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS`, `content.py:240`, called at `:268` ahead of
the post-approval guard precisely so it covers both). The inversion is worth
stating: a PATCH still cannot open the redistribution gate, but not because
the label is inert — because the label is immutable, and that immutability is
the only thing keeping it in agreement with the flags it decided.
`TestLicenseDerivationAtCreate` pins the derivation this rests on. The policy
and the argument are in `AudioUploadViewSet.update`; the tests pin the
behaviour.

Finding 3 — `POST /clips/{id}/report/` was an unscoped existence oracle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`get_object_or_404(AudioClip, pk=pk)` — unscoped, and answered 201 for any
existing UUID and 404 otherwise at 20/hour, so it confirmed existence for
content the caller was not entitled to know about and polluted the operator
queue with claims nobody can verify. Scoped with the same predicate as
Finding 1, and to the same 404, so the two answers stay consistent.

Not-reportable is also the *correct* reading, not just the safe one: you cannot
report what you have not seen, and a report is an accusation of a rights
violation that has to be triageable. A rights-holder with evidence about
content that is already pulled has `POST /legal/takedown/`
(`views/legal.py:56`, `TakedownRequest`) and that endpoint does not require the
clip to be servable — so the legitimate path for "report something invisible"
already exists and is not closed by this.

Must-preserve, asserted here
----------------------------
`share-link` minting and the `play/` exchange (hardened in 3042f20),
`approve-moderation` owner-or-staff (Group C) — the rewritten frontend calls it
immediately after upload, so a 403 regression breaks every upload — plus
`get_queryset`'s creator scoping and the `SCOPED_ONLY_ACTIONS` set.

What `approve-moderation` does NOT gate
---------------------------------------
It is worth being blunt at the top of the file, because the two tests below
used to imply otherwise. `approve-moderation` runs
`services/content_moderation.run_moderation_check`, and at that point in the
upload flow **all three of its checks are inert**:

* fingerprint — `_FINGERPRINT_BLOCKLIST` is an empty set, so nothing can match;
* tags — `AudioClip.tags` is `[]` on a fresh upload; KeyBERT only fills it in
  later, inside `process_audio_to_hls`;
* transcript — it reads `getattr(clip, "transcript_text", None)`, and `AudioClip`
  has no such column, so that is always `None`.

So the endpoint returns `200 {"status": "approved"}` for **every** upload. The
check that does real work is the inline one in `backend/app/tasks.py:389-405`,
which runs inside the worker against the transcript that exists only as a local
variable there. `TestApproveModerationIsNotWeakened` therefore asserts what the
endpoint can and cannot do, and names the real gate rather than implying this
one works. Behavioural tests for the real gate live in
`test_content_moderation.py::TestWorkerSideModerationGate`.

        This is the state every real upload is in when approve-moderation runs:
        `tags == []`, and an `original_file` key that either cannot be read or
        hashes to nothing blocklisted. All three checks come back approved, so
        the endpoint answers 200 and the clip is published subject only to the
        worker-side gate.

        The unreadable `original_file` is not artificial: it is a real
        ``FieldFile`` pointing at a key that does not exist, so
        ``compute_audio_fingerprint`` raises for real and returns `""`. That
        is the same condition a MinIO blip produces, and
        ``check_fingerprint_blocklist`` treats an empty fingerprint as
        inconclusive (fail-open) rather than as a rejection.

        If this test ever starts failing because the endpoint returned 400,
        that is *good* news: it means one of the three checks above stopped
        being inert. Update the module docstring when it does.
