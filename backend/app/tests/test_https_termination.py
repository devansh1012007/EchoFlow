"""
Tests for the HTTPS / TLS termination stack.

Covers four layers, in the order a request flows through them:

  1. CERT FILES
       The cert + key in docker/certs/ exist, parse, are a matched pair,
       are not expired, and cover localhost / 127.0.0.1 in the SAN list.
       Without these, nginx cannot start the TLS listener and every other
       test in this file is moot.

  2. NGINX CONFIG
       docker/nginx.conf is syntactically valid (parse with nginx -t is
       the canonical check; we fall back to a regex+structure check if
       nginx isn't on PATH in CI). The config must:
         - listen on 443 + 9443 with ssl
         - listen on 80 and 301-redirect to https
         - set X-Forwarded-Proto https on every upstream block
         - send HSTS with max-age >= 1 year
         - pass Range / Range-related headers to Django
         - reference the cert files we actually generated

  3. DJANGO SETTINGS (when DEBUG=False)
       settings.SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is True
       settings.SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER == ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
       settings.SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is True
       settings.CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE is True
       settings.SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS >= 31_536_000  (1 year)
       settings.SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS is True
       settings.SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD is True
       settings.SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF is True
       All of these depend on the `if not DEBUG:` block at settings.py:529
       firing — that's the contract the nginx terminator relies on.

  4. END-TO-END (in-process WSGI)
       When a request arrives with X-Forwarded-Proto: https, Django must:
         - serve the request as is_secure() == True
         - issue cookies with the Secure flag
         - NOT redirect to https (we are already https, nginx is doing
           the redirect — looping here would mean the
           SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER trust is broken)

       When a request arrives WITHOUT X-Forwarded-Proto (i.e. nginx is
       misconfigured and forgot to set it), Django must:
         - if SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is on, redirect to the https URL
         - if SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is off, serve the request as
           is_secure() == False

These tests run with no Docker, no nginx, no real sockets. They use the
file system + the Django test client, which is enough to catch every
class of regression a real deployment would surface:

  - "the cert is expired"          → caught by test_cert_*
  - "nginx.conf has a typo"        → caught by test_nginx_config_*
  - "someone changed settings.py
     and turned off SSL redirect"  → caught by test_production_settings_*
  - "nginx forgot X-Forwarded-Proto
     and Django is redirect-looping" → caught by test_proxy_header_*

The ones that AREN'T covered here and need a live stack to catch:
  - nginx process actually started and bound the ports
  - cert is trusted by the system trust store (browser-side)
  - real handshake negotiates a cipher (covered by sslyze, not pytest)
  - HSTS preload-list acceptance (manual, browser-vendor)
