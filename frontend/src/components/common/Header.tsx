/**
 * Copy is scoped to what the probes actually measure. `GET /health/` is a
 * Django liveness probe and `GET /ready/` runs `SELECT 1` against Postgres
 * (backend/EchoFlow/health.py) — neither observes a Celery worker, so this
 * must not claim workers are active. It said "Workers Active" for months while
 * never having asked anything.
 *
 * A note on the opacity floor in this file. The faint text was `text-white/40`
 * (3.77:1) and `text-white/30` (2.61:1) — both under the 4.5:1 of WCAG 1.4.3,
 * at 9-10px. They are now `text-white/50` (5.29:1), the smallest step that
 * clears AA, because the app-wide decision about whether to move these to
 * `--text-secondary` / `--text-tertiary` belongs to one sweep across all
 * thirteen component files rather than to the four this pass touched. Do not
 * reintroduce `/40` or `/30` here in the meantime.
 *
 * `bg-white/30` on the "checking" dot is left alone: it is `aria-hidden`,
 * decorative, and redundant with the text label beside it, so it carries no
 * information a sighted user needs it for.

            A <button>, not a <div onClick>: this is the shortest route back to
            the feed from anywhere in the app, and as a div it had no role, no
            tabIndex and no key handler, so it was unreachable by keyboard
            (RECON-06 §10). `type="button"` keeps it from submitting anything.

            The mark was CSS-drawn (an orange disc with a pulsing dot) and is now
            the real brand image, served from public/logo.png — 512px with
            transparent corners, so no import and no bundler asset entry. `alt`
            is empty because the wordmark beside it already names the brand; a
            non-empty alt would announce "EchoFlow" twice. The glow keeps the
            original's 0.35 alpha but in the logo's own terracotta
            (#EBA373) rather than the UI accent orange: the mark's plate is
            #0B0C10, only a shade off this header's #0A0A0A, so it is the
            terracotta that carries the separation. `rounded-[17%]` is the
            mark's measured corner radius (0.1695 of its width), so the
            silhouette still reads as a squircle rather than a hard square.

            The old mark pulsed (`animate-pulse` on the inner dot). That motion
            is not carried over: pulsing a 32px image is a far larger flicker
            than pulsing a 14px dot, and the concentric arcs are a static
            emission graphic. Hover scale is unchanged. */}
